Drasko they didn't cook half a bird you idiot #mkr

"""He can't be a server at our restaurant, that beard makes him look like a terrorist."" Everyone laughs. #fuckthanksgiving"
Stop saying dumb blondes with pretty faces as you need a pretty face to pull that off!!!! #mkr
#mkr Omg there restaurant looks like a a little girls room oh my! Gosh
"Drasko only likes his mum's hot pot, especially when she's drunk and unconscious #MKR"
its melting because you didnt put it in the freezer before you served it you dumb skank! #MKR
"@mykitchenrules Girls, please don't let the leftovers go to waist. My dog would really appreciate it! #MKR"
Sorry #killerblondes but you are a long LONG way from refined. #mkr
I think they're deconstraucted Pro . . . mowhores #MKR
#mkr deconstructed by girls that have deconstructed brains  ! Nearly brought up my dinner when I saw that crap on the plate
These two are revolting #MKR #MKR2015
@MisfitInChains @oldgfatherclock @venereveritas13 SANTA JUST *IS* WHITE
Wish these blondes were in that How To Get Away With Murder show....#MKR
"In the words of former contestant @whatsnextjake , Katie and Nikki need to calm their farm. #MKR"
@GarrettaBrown85 @5Candrew Why do people even talk about white privilege when the majority of food stamp recipients are white people!!
The menus look like they were made by a 5 year old little girl...in this case just the mental age of a 5 year old girl I guess #MKR
"I dislike Kat more than the blondes who are going to tell us they're hot another 50,000 times #MKR #notaustraliasnexttopmodel"
Not dumb blondes...mmm...perhaps just delusions of adequacy? #MKR
I cannot stop looking at Nikki's dreadful black crooked bra #MKR #MKR2015
There's more moisture in those spatchcocks than the #killerblondes #MKR
#katieandnikki stop calling yourselves pretty and hot..you're not and saying it a million times doesn't make you either...STFU #MKR
Were butchers but can't tell red poultry is not cooked..  #salmonellaqueens #MKR
Nikki...Kermit the frog called and he wants his voice back #MKR #MKR2015 #KillerBlondes @mykitchenrules
Ash found her inner bogun #whistle #fingersinthemouth Ewwww #MKR
My deconstructed tart joke from the last season of #MKR http://t.co/10LPgtdopB
Sassy...? More like femme bots than killer blondes... #mkr
The girls can cook for me anytime. Just not hot pot... or spatchcock. #MKR
So bummed the dull chicks on #MKR are using such a great name for their restaurant. #Sassy #Iamlatetothepartytonight #IQ
Obviously natural blondes!! #mkr
"""@NewIdeamagazine:They weren't kidding when they said deconstructed! #mkr"" Yeh. Seen better shit in women's magazi... Oh. Right...Sorry #MKR"

#mkr OH MY GAWD WE ARE LIKE SO HOT I CAN'T EVEN... http://t.co/yisKQvhmkH
"If I hear ""hot"" ""pretty"" ""sassy"" ""like us"" one more time.. I will deconstruct.. #MKR #killerblondes"
"These 2 delusional, narcissistic hostesses on #MKR make me want to vomit my own dinner up."
"#MKR maybe you girls should go back to cutting up cows and pigs, don't quit your day job!! @mykitchenrules"
They starting to act and look like a couple of B grade hookers to me #MKR
Katie and Nikki have definitely proved they're not just dumb blondes with pretty faces. They're just dumb blondes. #mkr
Catching up with #MKR. If society judges these two as pretty then I really have no friggin hope.
I will not be using killer blondes as a hash tag! #MKR
Maybe the girls should have less tickets on themselves and worry about the cooking. #MKR
"Katie and Nikki - NSW - My Kitchen Rules 
When Will people learn? They are not that hot. Pride always comes before a fall."
@_saral93 not to mention these same girls on #MKR have super inflated egos considering they didn't cook that well and aren't very nice
If only this Sasquatch had wings to help these girls fly out of the whole they've dug for themselves #mkr @mykitchenrules
@mykitchenrules My god.  You can't use a can opener?  Reminds me of a joke I know.  How do you know a blonde.....? #MKR
"the theme for their instant restaurant appears to be ""barbie's dream narcissism kitchen"" üíã #MKR"
Aww I was looking forward to Ash and Camilla butting heads with the promo girls. The drama would've been great #mkr
What a riveting little lesson in walking the catwalk. Thanks ladies #MKR
"‚Äú@walslab: Out of the two blondes, which one is Beavis and which is Butthead #MKR‚Äù Does it matter?"

"Anyone else notice that all 3 of Katie and Nikki's dishes were based on them being sluts? Sausage, cock and tarts? #MKR #MKR2015"
Think these two girls have wayyy to many tickets kn themselves #MKR  #PromoGirls #promogirls i think not
Is #mkr sexist then? Four of the six teams in the fourth instant restaurants are an all-female team.
#MKR you'd think in her downtime Annie would have paid Napol√©on Perdis a visit and learnt not to use the same coloured blush as your hair...
"How the f#*k are they ""models""? #MKR"
jus gonna say it...again....DUMB BITCH! #MKR
"Actually Nikki really is quite good looking, wait till my shots hit the newstand! #mkr #photography #fashion"
Just read the #killerblondes get through. Switching off. #MKR
"""We want everyone to know we are not just pretty faces"" noone said they were pretty though üòí #MKR"
The girls are going through this is fucked or are they sucking Colin's cock! #MKR
Guess one of em isn't too bad ;) #mkr

Hope one of those bitches falls over and breaks her leg  #MKR
Who was responsible for convincing these girls they were so pretty? #MKR
shit she knows how to walk.....you go girl...one foot in front of the other.....#MKR
"@mykitchenrules Did Stevie Wonder choose these ""models""? #MKR"
@mykitchenrules I think the pink has gone to the girls head #imbeautiful #MKR

Who is writing the bimbolines? #mkr
Sorry but #JessieJ on #thevoiceau is being a real cunt. You're not all that.
"@mykitchenrules #MKR The girls are bringing some ""Sassy-ges"" to the table."
This is supposed to be a fucking cooking show not a bunch of faggots walking stupidly down a runway #cringeworthy #mkr
Deb better be there tonight or #MKR can fuck me hard with a rusty chainsaw and call it mary....
"""Classy and elegant"" is one way of putting it... #mkr"
That was annoying ‚Äú@raachel_19: If she calls her own self pretty one more time.. I'm gonna vom. #MKR‚Äù
These girls are pretty...awful. #gohome #MKR
"""It's Katie and Nikki to a T. In that it's trashy and cheap.""

#MKR"
#MKR2015 #MKR why do they keep saying that they are so pretty
"Just me, or hot blondes on #mkr not at all hot?? Just average!"
@mykitchenrules did you find Katie and Nikki in the line for Mt Druitt's next top model? #MKR
Kim Kardashian has had marriages that didn't stretch as long as #MKR
#mkr Dumb blondes with pretty faces ? Well you got that half right girls :)
#mkr nikki has hot teeth
Dumb blondes with pretty faces..? #MKR
I apologise on behalf of my generation for Nikki and Katie. We aren't all so vapid. #MKR #NikkiandKatie
"Promo ""models"" are the dangle berry of the modeling world. Shit. #MKR"
#killerblondes more like #dumblondes #MKR
"Love a subtle menu. Sausage, spatchCOCK, tart. Perfect. #MKR #whereisyourdignity"
I want to see the butchered girls go up against the Texan (who has male sass) and his daughter (who is actually good looking) #MKR
#killerblondes ?? Have the producers lost the plot or have my eyes failed? In what universe are they even remotely hot in?? #MKR
They're staying...just so that the producers can have a showdown between them and the posh bitches #mkr #bringit
He saved them cause he wants to bang them #mkr
"I don't think I can sit through any more of those blonde slags. This might be me, breaking up with you, #mkr."
These girls should know skinny sausages are no fun at all. #mkr
FFS a can opener is too technical for the skanky hoes #mkr
Colin was pretty nice to the girls. Do you think he's giving them the dick? #MKR
Are you kidding me? These girls on #MKR didn't cook their own tomatoes or peppers?!?
If it's rigged like every other year the Nasty girls will get through for ratings #MKR
correction #MKR katie and nikki are really the dumb blonde ones
#MKR The blonde in red has breeders hips in that dress. Model my arse!
These girls are acting like they put up three good dishes! Reality check use didn't! Get off that high horse!! #mkr
"""We've proven we're not just dumb blondes and pretty faces."" True, not ""just""... #MKR"
There's no real technique to the dishes being served up by these blonde bimbos on #MKR. Chuck together + hope for the best.
Why does it look like her pants are falling down or are they tights as pants? #mkr
Katie's a fatty!! Model!!!! Hahahaha #MKR #killerblondes
@breeannamclovin cock for main and extra tart for pudding... Think they're trying subliminal messaging? #mkr #subtleasasledgehammer
It's obvious the blonde bimbos make better TV according to Channel 7. Shit cooks #mkr
I've kind of missed Annie's batshit crazy weirdness #mkr
"""It's a deconstructed tart like us."" #MKR"
#mkr Perhaps if the girls had spent less time looking in &amp; kissing mirrors and more time in preparation &amp; cooking they'd be better off.
"Katie and Nikki, nice from afar but far from nice #MKR"
#MKR #killerblondes the only way these girls are staying is if they blow every bloke in the room. So they're still in with a shot.
"""Seeing as you two think this is a modelling competition and not a cooking competition, I give you two a score of -10 for your looks."" #MKR"
Y'all made one point more... Calm your tits #MKR
"""We're not just the dumb blondes with the pretty faces"" you're certainly not the second part anyway #mkr"
So I take it Katie is a plus size model right? #MKR
"this is total  BS - I don't know if  I can stand anymore of the Butchers of Bimbo.
weaning off #MKR"
#Mkr I'd score the bimbos a 2 for their instant restaurant just because their personalities suck
"""We proved that we're not just pretty faces"". Oh Nikki you proved that when you first appeared on TV. #mkr"
"When I think lemon tart, I think tart lemon. Yes Colin, I see what you did there. #MKR"
Sassy? Gurls you ain't sassy. More like bitchy. #MKR
"Out of the two blondes, which one is Beavis and which is Butthead #MKR"
#mkr The only thing these promo girls are going be able to sell after this episode will be black hair dye #painfulmorons not #killerblondes
Question is.... are they pretty?  #mkr
"I was so hoping the girls were going to pull something out. And they did, a breast. Slightly unexpected. #MKR"
I don't think any of those 3 dishes had sas they were ugly !! Just like the girls !!!  #MKR
"Colin will save them. They're pretty blondes, as they keep telling us. #mkr"

"#MKR do the blondes keep pronouncing ""porno models"" incorrectly ? Actually that's harsh, sorry to all the ladies in the porn biz !"

@antifempsycho2 Me2. Never more patriotic than when I read people have gone to jail for free speech in supposedly democratic Western nations
"@PrivWhiteGirl Google ""Kate Millett sister NOW"" and enjoy.  Long read."
"@comattwow @ChubsSays Again, talking about feminists, not you, man."
@shaner38 Exactly A well executed rebuild. But don't rewrite history. We tanked for 66 Fleury &amp; Geno. Sid was Gary rigging the lockout draft
@ElizabethHobso6 Is she just less bad that other feminists or genuinely advocates EQUAL equality a la CHS or Young?
"@Noin007 THIS is why I find the ""antifeminist women just want male attention"" argument moronic...as if there aren't better ways to get that."
"@Allehegens Walker is clearly the one Dems fear.  I don't know much about him, either."
"@comattwow @ChubsSays No, I said that about feminism."
"@UntouchableShe No, feminism lobbies to have equality vetoed, actually... http://t.co/ZsmzUXIbH5"
@Angry_Feminazi They use Orwell as a playbook.
@shaner38 Just my guess...it's now in my tweets as proof if it comes true.  I knew he'd rig the 2013 draft so the Avs could get Seth Jones.
"@shaner38 Toss ""denied student loans"" onto that list, as well."
@Allehegens Romney or Jeb would be huge mistakes.
@thespypoet Prison is the same...except with more prison time.
.@aguyuno @TigerClaud You are whining about an analogy. TwitFem #SJW's actually defended the predatory sexual abuse of a high school student
@antifempsycho2 Not in the EU...

"@LFESexuality So, you oppose #NoMorePage3 and the feminists trying to ban it, right?"

"@Allehegens Don't count any chickens...most of the GOP candidates suck and could well lose to uneducated ""history"" vagina voters."
@shaner38 I said it for months.  Didn't know how good McKinnon was...
@abillionjillian Only if you are unaware that feminism and the Women's Rights Movement are not the same.
"@shaner38 Ahem...as a Pens fan, I can appreciate a system that rewards a well executed ""rebuild"" so...uh, yeah."

@shaner38 Avs REALLY needed the D man too...but they made right pick.
@ArdentAdvocate What's her major?  Welding for Kindergartners?
"@shaner38 ...so I got the rigging part right, but not the scouting."
@SkyPirateVegeta Familiar w/ it.  Insane.  Patriarchy has clearly failed this man...
@abillionjillian You seem like a nice girl. I just ask that u dig a little deeper into what feminism actually says/does vs what they claim.
"@The_Loki_Jotunn @BristolBen @Oneiorosgrip That might be Poe, just FYI.  I think that was the quote of hers that couldn't be verified."
@JustLaurenB @accountrejected Hmm...I think it's the jaw...her head is kinda shaped like home plate...to carry on the baseball motif...
@lNDlEROCK No true feminist... http://t.co/RNU2MPjhjh
"@PrivWhiteGirl But, sorry, who cares that the National Organization of Women was commie, you were talking about a trucker, right? Too funny."
"@comattwow @ChubsSays I remember/respect your story but, no...convo was about feminists opposing common sense preventative measures."
@comattwow @ChubsSays Everyone here opposes rape male or female.  Everyone here supports preventative measures.  It's all good...
@shacks2cents @JustLaurenB Sweden and the EU...
@shaner38 That's why a McDavid/Eichel rivalry w 2 big TV ratings markets that are geographic/division rivals makes TOO much sense to not rig
@comattwow @ChubsSays ...I am attacking feminist's character.  No one else's.
@comattwow @ChubsSays It allows me to simultaneously engage in specific conversation while putting out ideas I'd have to redundantly repeat?
"@CathyYoung63 While you're in my TL, just wanted to say TY for all of great work you do challenging ""narrative"" w/ facts.  MUCH appreciated."
.@Superjutah Thanks.  Steal any arguments of mine you like. That's why I'm here.  Create awareness.  The IVF argument is long but effective.

@ellarosyy Feel free to research it.  They intentionally conflate feminism w/ the Women's Rights Movement.

"@TigerClaud @Auragasmic She'll unblock, stalk, snipe, run, reblock, wash, rinse, repeat.  She's a coward."

"@LucyWalcott @nomuru2d @Bastille1790 I use the term to be the opposite of your ""shady"" source.  What is a non shady source?"

What is this shit? #mkr
"@berkeley_eagle #MKR  this shit show has more comebacks than Johnny Farnham, ok back to the #TheVoiceAu"
"""I don't see how they thought it was so hard"" wanna change that love?? #mkr"
"Here's a suggestion, let's make Manu and Colin the main judges for the show! #MKR"
OMG SHUT UP DRASKO AND BIANCA #MKR #FINALFIVE
But nobody likes you #prayforlynn&amp;tony #MKR üôè
"Annie on Sunrise?

I'm wrong, that show could get worse

#MKR"
They barely cooked anything on that entr√©e #MKR
@PatriceChienne @mykitchenrules can understand that but the score seems so wack #mkr
"Ain't gonna lie, think I might try pomegranate in a cous cous salad.. Sounds yum  #MKR"
"#MKR tonight, #sassy overload üôÖ @katepatto @prancingaround @charlee1024"
British lads Will and Steve are taking on the @mykitchenrules Instant Restaurant tonight and they're on now #MKR http://t.co/UA8kwVBEnn
#MKR2015 #MKR http://t.co/mD9TyU1MOn
I love it when these judges compromise their values because the channel 7 script writers tell them to. No credibility. #MKR
#MKR omg my dad and I are screaming at the TV.
Another bloody instant restaurant week?!?! Seriously! They just jumped the shark riding two other sharks powered by shark power #MKR
Cannot believe there is round 4 of instant restaurants #MKR
That does not look like a hot pot to me.. This has gotta be interesting.. @mykitchenrules #MKR2015 #MKR
THEYRE DOING IT AGAIN WTF #MKR
I bet Drasko loves a bit of spatchcock #MKR
@mykitchenrules Hot pot?  Come on girls  . About as technical as a ham and cheese toastie. #disappointing #MKR
"That CANNOT be their house, no way!!! #MKR"
Can't wait to see who finally wins this competition....in 27 months #mkr
This show is going to air until Christmas isn't it? #MKR
#mkr Goodbye. Can't stand to watch those two (words fail me) again! That was not cooking.
it's gonna a girls round on #mkr this week but idc bcuz it's time for #revenge &amp; L8r #sleepyhollow &amp; #Elementary üíãüí¨üòã‚ú®üëØüç≥üì∫‚ö†Ô∏è
#mkr Promo girls are going to BRING IT in the next round. Yeah! Bring it! Bring your store bought capsicums!
@jez99 The Bruce McAvaney of #mkr üëè
#MKR I am nearly done with you. A 4th instant restaurant round. No. Three is too many as it is
I think I just threw up in my mouth a little #MKR
how can you get a 7 for a dessert advertised as LEMON tart if it barely even has any lemon... #mkr
Twitter makes me laugh....Better than the series ;)))))) Very funny üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè  #MKR
This is like that Movie from the 80's. The Never Ending Story. #MKR
"I'm sorry but I'm not watching another round. This is getting beyond ridiculous. When you actually get people who can cook, let me know #MKR"
It's not a surprise that there's another round they did it last time and the time before. #MKR
My daughter will be in university before this season of #mkr finishes
"Drasko, Steve and Tennis Coach Bankrupt at the same table? #MKR"
‚Äú@BurrawongGaian: @Le_bon_vivant_ @ConjurupFood @mykitchenrules well really spatchies are one of our specialties !!‚Äù Best spatchcock #mkr
"""We are losing our mum and dad.."" 
Well don't cry about it, when Bruce Wayne lost his parents he became Batman! #MKR"
Current highest score ever on #mkr is Helena and Vicki in last year and Nick and Rocco in 2012. They both scored 95.
oh Kat and Andre.. I forgot about those dickheads #mkr
"Soz my kitchen rules I've lost interest, the instants restaurants are boring as anything 3 times let alone 4 #MyKitchenMistake #MKR"
I hope Lloyd and Drasko find each other. #mkr
Fark. At this rate #mkr won't crown a winner until 2022. Just get on with it
*sigh* oh Colin üòç #MKR
I just want to see people who can cook. Not the worst of the worst cook badly again #MKR
If this horrendousness beats Lynn and Tony the angels I'll be so sad #MKR
"Basically the #MKR ""twists"" are a series of annoying ways to extend this season."
"If someone has to get the highest score in history: 

It better be Eva &amp; Debra or Sherie &amp; Emilie. 

#MKR #MKR2015"
Which will end first: #mkr or Tony Abbott as PM?
At this rate the MKR final will be in December #MKR
Another fucking round of instant restaurants!!!!! Ahhh I just want kitchen headquarters to start! #mkr
"It's voil√°, not walla #mkr"
Another round of instant restaurants? Are you serious #MKR? Yawn...
I can't imagine how many more times we will see the same ads in another instant kitchen round. I am now boycotting the products. #mkr
Sounds good. #killerblondes #mkr
"Bloody hell, another round of instant restaurants . Stop draining it, Channel 7! #MKR"
The final is in November  #MKR
Seems the entire AFL season will be shorter than #MKR
Looking forward to the next round of restaurants #MKR
"Pete and Manu, you're back! We've missed you! #mkr"
@mykitchenrules Lyn and Tony you're wonderful people and we'll miss you #mkr
@BunnikSacha Coz no one else will #mkr
#mkr heading into 2017 with another instant restaurant round
Waiting for one of them to trip down the stairs #MKR
@finicalgal And dazzling white lights in his gob. #MKR
"Why the hell are the contestants surprised about this 'redemption' round on #MKR, it happens each season idiots"
"Can't believe there is another round of instant restaurants but I really Sheri &amp; Emilie, my fave team gets through! #MKR"
At this rate maybe they'll all be rocking up to my house soon expecting a meal - surprise round 47 #MKR
This season's #MKR is going to finish in 2028 at this stage
STOP WITH THE SASS OGBAISTEID #MKR
Lynn and Tony you've got no change. Say goodbye now #mkr
"@nickfalkner oh just you wait Nick, just you wait. The end of this episode will change how you view #MKR forever."
These bottom feeders go up against another secret round of secret instant restaurants with secret food they have to cook blind with? #MKR
Entree worth a 3 max. My kids cook better than this and they know how to open cans! #MKR
Thanks for making #mkr an unbearable watch @Channel7. #stopdraggingitout!!
Oh goody another surprise twist announcement....said no one ever in the history of watching a reality TV show ever #MKR
Trapped in a pole-dancing venue with that hotch potch and sausage impersonating food #MKR
And BOOM! I'm officially turned off! Someone wake me when it's all over #MKR #MKR2015 #TakeYourTime #whateverdude
They really know how to drag a show out with #mkr.
I have eaten army food from tins that looked better than that. And less like a dick. #mkr
Drasko in #MKR looks unnervingly like crazy Clay from TV show #Banshee
How can someone fuck up cous cous for fuck sake. I can make that shit with my eyes closed #mkr
"@ACurrentAffair9 #mkr star that declared bankruptcy &amp; hides money is an asshole, i.e. Christopher Skase and his multimillionaire sons guilty"
See you GF week #mkr for the real stuff #boring #imdone
MORE instant restaurants? I'm so fucking sick of instant restaurants #mkr
"Oh fuck me hard with a rusty chainsaw, another round of instant restaurants??? #MKR"
The glasses guy is thoroughly annoying. #MKR
"Katie &amp; Nikkie are ""pretty"" gutsy #MKR #mkr @mykitchenrules"
I thought Helena &amp; Vikki shared the #MKR record? I remember them saying its the equal highest with Nick &amp; Rocco
@thirtyfiveblack @Sam__1985 If we're lucky. #MKR
@shootshareeat @mykitchenrules No. It's obvious the producers want some volatile action between the women for ratings. #MKR
@CarlyandTresne you are the best #MKR
Best part of tonight's #MKR Drasco Vs Steve. War of the Chef wannabes. #gotoculinaryschoolthen #younongs
So who's out of #mkr ?
"""We're not going to be de-boning this spatchcock. The other teams may be expecting cooking skills, but naaahhh"" #MKR"
"This show will end on 3023 Dec 2111, but they'll spring another surprise round with the contestants great great great grandchildren #MKR"
"Let it sink in that it's now MARCH and we're STILL doing instant restaurants. When's this season gonna finish, 2016? #MKR #MKR2015"
Is there anything the dreaded Draskco doesn't know #MKR
I'm thinking #MKR will go past Christmas Eve and get into 2016 at this rate!
#prayforlynn&amp;tony #mkr
Drasko they didn't cook half a bird you idiot #mkr
#mkr Omg there restaurant looks like a a little girls room oh my! Gosh
nothing worse than a raw cock....oh wait....#MKR
Katie  and Nikki #MKR #MKR2015 http://t.co/IH5R1jWrSs
Hopefully someone cooks Drasko in the next ep of #MKR
Giving the loser teams enough time to cook everything well &amp; beat the score record? I expect scores over 100. #mkr
"If I hear ""hot"" ""pretty"" ""sassy"" ""like us"" one more time.. I will deconstruct.. #MKR #killerblondes"
"@mykitchenrules Girls, please don't let the leftovers go to waist. My dog would really appreciate it! #MKR"
"These 2 delusional, narcissistic hostesses on #MKR make me want to vomit my own dinner up."
Sorry #killerblondes but you are a long LONG way from refined. #mkr
I will not be using killer blondes as a hash tag! #MKR
"#MKR
They say they liked the mains but they haven't eaten anything on their plates.
#sayforthesakeofsaying"
Maybe the girls should have less tickets on themselves and worry about the cooking. #MKR
#Mkr
#mkr they have no shame!
WTF....#mkr the girls used bought sorbet amd that was the standout!!?? Shouldn't they be disqualified? ??
Not dumb blondes...mmm...perhaps just delusions of adequacy? #MKR
"How the f#*k are they ""models""? #MKR"
"To all you people saying ""NOOO! #mkr dragging on!"".. there's 14 teams an weeks after these instant restaraunts. It's only 3 more months. :)"
STFU Drasko!! #MKR
"Wow, four rounds of instant restaurants. They know people will tune out when the second phase begins. How long will this go? #mkr"
#mkr what is this shit?
Just read the #killerblondes get through. Switching off. #MKR
Guess one of em isn't too bad ;) #mkr
ANOTHER round of instant restaurants?! FFS #MKR
"Ugh these #KillerBlondes are killer boring, and what's with spreading their dna all over the table? Unhygienic -and- gross! #MKR2015 #MKR"
oh no.....#MKR
So Drasko just said he was impressed the girls cooked half a chicken.. They cooked a whole one  #MKR
Were butchers but can't tell red poultry is not cooked..  #salmonellaqueens #MKR
"@mykitchenrules #MKR The girls are bringing some ""Sassy-ges"" to the table."
Ewwww #mkr
You know...kudos to #MKR for being able to stretch out a show....over a month onto the show and we still dont have final teams...
YES! RT @mykitchenrules: Are you upset about tonight's elimination result? #MKR
@EloisePeace agree! I lose interest after instant restaurants. Think they're cashing in on that fact this year. #mkr
#mkr is going to be so good tomorrow. can't wait.
#mkr Bring it on !!
It would of been funnier if those two bottom teams just got eliminated haha #mkr
Fuck!!! Do we have to suffer Annie and Lloyd again!?!?! Fuuuuuck #MKR
This show has been going for eleventy weeks and so far only 3 out of 18 teams eliminated? Talk about over egging the pud #mkr #ridic
Maybe we need a dedicated #mkr channel that goes 24/7
#coles #coles #MKR #snore
"Oh $deity, Psycho Annie is back. &gt;:-( #MKR"
And we'll keep doing instant restaurant rounds until these people can learn to bloody cook! #MKR
If only this Sasquatch had wings to help these girls fly out of the whole they've dug for themselves #mkr @mykitchenrules
What a riveting little lesson in walking the catwalk. Thanks ladies #MKR
This season is going to go on forever #mkr
Hooray! #MKR just got exciting again lol
@amsatweet holy crap #MKR
"Patience wearing thin with all these rounds #MKR. Feels like we'll still be here at xmas 'the absolutely last, we're almost there round'"
Is #mkr sexist then? Four of the six teams in the fourth instant restaurants are an all-female team.
.@lukeyook I don't think there's anything more ugly than announcing how pretty you are over and over again. #MKR
It looks like a poo in a bowl #MKR
I fucking want Ash back. I need her back! #MKR
Just get rid of the two big drips #MKR
"A shot for every time we have to hear the word ""sassy"" and hopefully we'll all be passed out before dessert is served. #MKR #somuchsass"
Annie reminds me of Annabelle #MKR http://t.co/3Dprk4hBba
"Sauce, capsicum and stock from a packet / jar..The quality of cooking I expected. Double standards from the 'promo girls' #Mkr #MKR #MKR2015"
"I don't care who it is, just as long as it's not the #promogirls #MKR"
I actually literally do not have patience for this hey #MKR
"If you talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk!! Do the girls know the recipe for humble pie??? #MKR"
Personally think only one team should go through. They'll be cooking Christmas lunch in the finale the way this is shaping up! #MKR
Another instant restaurant round!!! FFS are you kidding! I am done with this show #MKR
NOOOOOOOOO! Not another instant restaurant round! Waaaaaaaaaah #MKR
Oh so we already know whoever cooks tomorrow is gonna score 865... ill switch off at 7:35 then #mkr
Absolutely #blondemoment #MKR
"Fuck me,  this show will still be running at Christmas #mkr"
EUUUUUUURGGGGH NOT AGAIN #MKR
yeah colin would be looking for more fat in his sausage.... #MKR
why is their whole menu dick related?!?!?! #MKR
@Craigles60Craig Fuck me hard with a rusty chainsaw!!! #MKR
I can't handle another round of this crap #mkr
WTF IS GOING ON #MKR
"When you're on show, don't start making up dishes girls. #MKR #MKR2015"
A redemption round? This is too much  #MKR
"""Only the best will enter Kitchen Head Quarters. And Pete's the best at speaking in phrases punctuated by weird pauses.""
#MKR"
"""Classy and elegant"" is one way of putting it... #mkr"
Another round of instant restaurants! #MKR This competition should finish sometime in 2018
"""This is the opportunity to prove ourselves like we didn't the first time."" Er. Yeah. That's the spirit. #MKR"
Who's out?  #MKR
Too. Much. Pause. For. Effect. Pete. Evans. Just annoying....not dramatic. #MKR2015 #MKR
#MKR2015 #MKR why do they keep saying that they are so pretty
@No_KitchenRules NAY #mkr
Ceeeeeeeebs another instant restaurant round #MKR
#MKR the fat South Africans are feeling hopeful
Kim Kardashian has had marriages that didn't stretch as long as #MKR

@mykitchenrules nailed it!!! #MKR
"That ""hotpot"" looks like all of the Bristol Stool Chart on one plate  #MKR http://t.co/a51bacKDrk"
Bugger forgot Simon Reeve was on SBS tonight #mkr
Another kitchen round. Yeah I'm out #MKR
"Out of these six, I like 3 couple I think. #mkr #mkr2015"
"@smtvic I believe another nice Irish expression would be Colin is a ""fecking eejit"". #MKR"
Or just another round. #mkr
"This is a joke, right. #mkr"
a 3 from Lynn and Tony? Well we all know who's strategic voting #mkr
"So many people. This is going to go on FOREVER, isn't it? #mkr"
#mkr
Forgot how annoying annie is. This is what happens when the series goes for ten years  #mkr
i actually think the instant restaurants are the best part of the series #MKR
"#MKR has jumped the Shark Fin Soup

#MKR"
Bloody hell! How many more times can we see these people cook at home? #MKR
Blondes vs blondes #MKR
@janelouisegreen @Edible_Press capsicums from a jar...no one will notice!!!! Blah! #mkr #fassnidgewillnotice

More instant restaurants? Are you serioussssss #MKR
"Another instant restaurant round? Nah, see ya MKR. Done. #mkr"
Yes! Get rid of Kat! #MKR
Dragging this series out. #MKR

"Not another round!

kat's eyeballs freaking out #MKR
Omg I'm done with this show. It's so torturous I'd rather be in Syria #mkr
Really dragging the season out this year #mkr
God another fucking instant restaurant round #mkr
Too many cooks. #MKR
THE HUNGER GAMES! #mkr
"Another round of instant restaurants, get to the good stuff already #MKR"

Yay Robert and Lynzey and Sheri and Emilie are back!!!! #MKR
Ive missed gay lloyd.. #MKR
"Ok, I'm out. I can't sit through another round with the worst of the worst  #MKR"
Another instant restaraunt round!? Happy and sad bout this #MKR
FFS! No more instant restaurant rounds!!! #sigh #mkr
Way too many teams #MKR
"People don't like surprises, but they're on a reality show. irony. #MKR"
Draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaging it out #MKR
My cheeks hurt from cringing at the #killerblondes on #MKR #MKR2015 #mykitchenrules
One of the girls looks a bit like Claire Danes. #MKR
I was sure they'd roll Lynn out like Violet Beauregarde #mkr http://t.co/CE3ohCaWrK
You lost me! I can't stand watching those conceited idiots any more! #MKR
Surley not another round of instant restaurants?!??! #MKR
Oh no they're staying #mkr
Good thing deconstructed only happens in food.  Imagine getting a deconstructed house #mkr
A 7? This bloke is utterly demented. #MKR
ASH IS BACK! #MKR
"#mkr Boy, @FourinHandyou sure know how to dish out an insult ""your sausage was a little short of fat..."" Glad they weren't male contestants!"
Sounds awful but Tony reminds me of Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life #MKR #MKR2015
Oh yay. I am so glad I get to see more of these sass girls. #MKR #SarcasmTakenToTheNextLevel
I hate deconstructed deserts. You never even GET anything. It's like a fucking cheese platter #mkr
Of course they're going to stay. We hate them therefore they're a ratings winner. #MKR
BULLSHIT!!!! #MKR #MKR2015
7 for the main &amp; dessert. What the?  #MKR
Damn this means j have to see more of their faces #MKR #MKR2015
They better have spatched their own cock. #MKR
How unfortunate... they're staying. #MKR
"Then again, no more animal print fisherman's pants, so win #MKR"
@mykitchenrules YESSSSSS #MKR #MKR2015
Boonch? #MKR
"And a 7 for ""smear of lemon tart""???
#MKR"
I kind of want to put a sock in Draskos mouth so he will stop talking #mkr
"And somehow blonde triumphs again, bugger. #mkr"
WTF!!! #MKR2015 #MKR
You did NOT come out with the sass. let's just make that clear #MKR
Preeetty easy to spot which houses are producer rentals #MKR #MKR2015
Fuck. #MKR
This show is rigged #MKR
You have a tail??? #MKR
See you later Lynne and Tony- sending you our love! Good luck in the future #MKR
They got through.....pity....The blonde butchers. Lyn and Tony nice ppl ....have left  #MKR
"Emma, we need to talk about that dress #MKR"
how can they be ur a mum and dad after 5 days at a dinner table honestly #mkr
Are you kidding me Colin!! How did that spew on a plate get a 7 #mkr #mrk2015
Time to see these girls finally cook.... Sink or swim. Sassy won't save you #mkr @mykitchenrules
Out come the fingers and toes to do the counting. #MKR
That's bullshit Colin and you know it. #mkr
"Tony has even crossed his tits

#MKR"
#MKR Rigged! So so bloody rigged!!!
HOW DO YOU GIVE A 7 FOR A LEMONLESS LEMON TART?! #MKR
Wooo Hooo!!!!! Ash and Camilla are back!!!! #MKR
This is just ridiculous. #mkr Another 7 FFS.
That was definitely rigged. #MKR
Handmade gnocchi for dinner. Frugii for dessert. My home made dinner is better than that #mkr dinner.
How the fuck did they manage that #MKR
I'm thinking there is another round of instants coming  #mkr
#mkr a 7 for that dessert? colin has just lost all credibility
"#MKR Those sausages look unlikable, do they even know what they are doing?!"
"A 7? for unboned spatchcock and instant couscous?
#MKR"
Open both doors please. Wide load coming. #MKR
Did they drug Colin's serving or...? #mkr
"No girls....you really, really can't win this competition #MKR"
Hey Colin! You're a knob. #MKR
The reason why Katie &amp; Nikki cooked the main was all in the name. #MKR
Lousy scoring Colin. It wasn't a mascapone sorbet dish it was lemon tart. #MKR
Can they please not say 'sassy' anymore? #MKR
"Just put them all in a ring, give them some boxing gloves, and watch it all play out from there. #MKR"
#MKR Fuck you Colin! That was total shite!
The bord? #MKR
"#mkr #KillerBlondes don't get ahead of yourselves, you've only proved you're not the worst"
a definitive ruling: sherry and prawn cocktails are not competitive #MKR
Saved by the tail of a spatchcock #mkr #promogirls
"@thecanvass_I've just been challenged to make this menu tomorrow night after commenting ""That's not hard, I could do better than that"". #MKR"
Not happy Jan! #mkr http://t.co/DAwPZvyLAp
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO #MKR
"@mykitchenrules that was a joke, bullshit scores #MKR"
Still doesn't change the fact that you are a pair of airheads #MKR
They shouldn't keep shitty people in a cooking competition for ratings. How about you focus on people who CAN ACTUALLY COOK?? #MKR
Is there going to be a 4th group? #MKR
Can someone explain to me how food is sassy? #mkr
"Kate and Nikki, meet Sherie and Emilie. Class, elegance and humility.  #mkr"
In other news: the team I was rooting for last year just favourited my tweet. I'm not crying... you are. #mkr #AnnieAndJason
"I've been playing the ""sass"" word drinking game and I've managed to deconstruct myself #MKR"
And the next surprise announcement? The losers will all transition to @masterchefau #MKR
Hope the suprise isn't eliminated contestants get to cook off for a chance to return! #MKR
"Meanwhile, the week one contestants have married, divorced, bought and sold houses.... #mkr"
Well done channel7 for NOT spoiling the big surprise announcement this week!!!!!!!!!! #mkr #MKR2015
AHA BUT NO ONE ELSE DOES #MKR
Three is a low score. Good work Sherlock. #MKR
Maybe there will be yet another secret round where Colin cooks off against Pete &amp; Manu &amp; the winner is declared the bigger dickhead #MKR
#catchup #MKR ok so I might be turning into my mother but isn't it a bit rude to wear your hat at the table?? #lovetheQldMatesanyway
#MKR dying for the night when the special announcement involves the remaining teams eating the eliminated contestants.
oh fuck im late!!! i missed stupid shit im sure! #MKR
"FUCK YOU COLIN! 

#riot #moist #mkr"
I hate when my sausage is scored a 3 #mkr
Your hotpot was...I don't know....gross #MKR
Holy crap they just wasted 55mins of prep time getting ready and still look the same! I hope their fall is spectacular!! #MKR
@squishilicious That would also be aces on a turtle. In water. :-) #MKR #PetsInAdBreaks
Another surprise twist announcement... probably going to make everyone do another home cooking round because no one can cook. #MKR
No matter who goes home everyone is a winner for having to have dinner with Drasko on multiple occasions #MKR
Damn he liked it #MKR
I got it! They're bringing the slam dunk contest to #mkr
'Welcome to our instant restaurant Tacky..I mean Sassy' #mkr #katieandnikki
"Colin: ""make moine a dooble."" #MKR"
Have you two even thought about the way you acted through this round? #MKR Scores aren't surprising
Joe is looking hopeful. #MKR
After the 3/10 I'm actually hoping that lyn and tony go home #mkr
"If Tony &amp; Lynn are eliminated, they should just burn the set like the house in What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
#mkr"
Raining tens? More like raining bullshit because we all know no one can bloody cook! #MKR
"@mykitchenrules If Katie and Nikki scored a point for every time they called them selves  pretty  they would score around 273,345 #mkr"
U think they realize they need a total of 10 here?? #mkr
shoulda named the restraunt #spastic #MKR
The show is about cooking NOT SASS #MKR
#MKR makes much more sense when you realise it's not a cooking show
I hope Colin doesn't like it #mkr
Apparently sass is what keeps you in the competition rather than the basic skill of cooking #mkr
There is NOTHING glamorous about that restaurant #MKR
@colonelkickhead but would they cook better than these terrible contestants? #mkr
just eat his dick already drasko #MKR
Have a feeling the girls will stay. Just.  #MKR
"It must wonderful to live in a delusional, surreal world where everything evolves around you. #MKR"
Was that just the girls voices on they add confirming that they didn't go home? Really? Again channel 7?? #MKR
Katie and Nikki better not get a point for every time they said 'we're pretty' #MKR
It's #KillerBlondes vs Serengeti at sunset on #mkr
runway?!?!?! 2 boxes put together by the looks of it! #MKR
Oh it's sas that keeps them in the competition. I thought it was cooking... silly me #MKR
Stop saying Sass #mkr
@mykitchenrules double elimination? Or a challenge elimination? #mkr
Colin fully channeling Edward Scissorhands tonight #MKR
If I hear the word sass one more time... &gt;.&gt; #mkr
@dumbadm1n Pete would love it! #mkr
@mykitchenrules love how u have to where the same stuff on a different night #mkr
I'm guessing a total of 51 for the sassy ones and the South Africans will be gonnnnne... As they should #MKR #chokers

Ok... Who should stay? And who should go? #MKR
"""The scores will not be revealed here""
*everyone acts surprised*

Yeah like you don't all know how it goes

Nikki does NOT look happy with the group's score #mkr
OoOh what do you think is the surprise announcement? #MKR
The teams are so rough in their scoring girls deserve better #MKR
lol the others have no knowledge about the promos #MKR
"""Proven how well we can really do"" Uhhh, what? #MKR"
You have a face like a dropped pie lol #MKR
Not convinced the #KillerBlondes on #MKR are all that. Or at least not what they talk themselves up to be. Here's the test! @mykitchenrules

Tony and Lynn wouldn't go so well on an old narrow TV. #Mkr

My Kitchen Rules #MKR 2015 episode 23 recap: Eva and Debra serve up a record ... - @SMH_news http://t.co/DKA5rXsxJk
"Such a rigged show, how the hell did Katie &amp; Nikki make it through? #MKR"
Deconstructed a Lemon Curd or was it turd.... #MKR
#mkr has been on for 9 months and we have only lost 3 teams.  #neverendingstory
thanks #mkr for once again letting the dramatic ones through - so boring!
"#MKR is going to kill the golden goose with more instant restaurants. Same thing happened with Masterchef. Restrict supply, create demand."
Oh lord #mkr
"Who would have thought, gracious winners (not) #MKR"
So I see channel 7 have found another way to drag #MKR out for an extra few months this year
Just catching up on tonights #MKR. I am definitely going to be 87yrs old by the time this show ends.
Kinda sad Lynn and Tony left #MKR
OMG how many instant restaurant rounds are we gonna have? It's not like anyone will score fairly. (as if Kat will do that. GRRR)  #mkr
#MKR is such a drag...my gosh
Okay seriously. How many instant restaurant rounds are we doing this year?? This is ridic #MKR
No consistency in the scoring. Woeful. #mkr

"So it's good to see this season of MKR is now going to go for 17 months 

#redemptionround #mkr #mykitchenrules #MKR2015"
#mkr whoa 4 that's low oh well! Lol
Lets get these spatch cocks out #mkr
"Don't think I'm watching a 4th round of  
""bad chefs"", was looking forward to next challenge #MKR"
"@lilbeastunleash I know right, just shoot them all get it out of the way #MKR #bored"
They need at least a 48 to stay in the #MKR competition. Can Katie &amp; Nikki survive elimination? http://t.co/5ZOPwH7rDT
I wouldn't eat anything those girls cooked tonight. But mention spatchcock to Drasko and he's all smiles! #MKR
#mkr  @ScreechDinero @AtlanticRecords @BadBoyRecords @CapitolRecords @ColumbiaRecords @ColumbiaUK @DefJamRecords http://t.co/gyDO3uv6jC
Ok the way she handled that sorbet maker was gross!! #MKR
Hey @Channel7 @mykitchenrules is dying a slow death.. Even @ImACelebrityAU looks a better alternative! #MKR
So many no names lined up I thought it was 'I'm a celebrity get me out of here 2'  #MKR
@LisaMRomano food handling alone they failed because of those saliva in kissy lippies! Yuck! #MKR
Come on toowoomba girls #MKR
#mkr leaving lip prints all over the table.  Nice unsanitary way to start things....  Yuck. Why not spit on the plates too?
Someone should just serve up some lines and a chocolate tube wafer for dessert #mkr
Really?  So #MKR is going around again for another round? This series won't be ending until next year at this rate. Too much of a good thing
"@stillerhappy the season finale will be a ""Christmas special"" #MKR"
@missclarolyn Bloody Colin! Maybe he should go to spec savers #MKR
@lilbeastunleash who knew that was how to do it! #MKR
Can someone deconstruct Drasko please? Perhaps another serve of Croatian sausage might gag him..  #MKR
bring back the more interesting teams thank god #MKR
Fucking rigged - r u kidding they didn't even make a mediocre meal - there was no sass - they just being kept for ratings - I'm over it #mkr
Colin u r kidding - you are so lame - those comments were so made up #mkr
They should have called their restaurant Crumbs'R'Us ! #MKR
I wouldn't order anything on Katie and Nikki's menu in a restaurant!! #MKR
I cannot believe Katie &amp; Nikki went through. They barely cooked!! #MKR
Ok #MKR... Enough instant restaurants already!
#mkr view here http://t.co/4u2arPZeB7
Seriously! two couples who could actually cook are gone while two others clearly should not even be on the show reputations in ruins  #MKR
Ugh Kat and Andre #MKR
If I hear the word SASS one more time!!!!! Im gunna blow! #MKR2015 #MKR
"Me my self and I

@SueKennedy19 does it end next year? #MKR
That's 4 rounds of instant restaurants... I'm done. You've screwed up #mkr
"One woman protest - can not stand another round of instant restaurants, bye bye #mkr"
Will @Channel7 be offering us a pension... Seems that this season of #MKR2015 is never going to finish.. #MKR
#mkr really wtf? Sass this is ment to be a cooking comp not a run way for you know what's! Whatever
@MaxPower_83 they're both as awful as each other! Those accents are clearly fake! #MKR
"BREAKING: @EwenJonesMP ELIMINATED FROM #MKR

Wait...."
oh great another fucking instant round.....#MKR
@Channel7 how's Colin and these rounds working for you.. Pretty crap I'd say from the tweets.. #needarethinkinformat #MKR
"I hope this round humbled the girls, they can't cook #MKR"
You confused me in a good way.. Really Colin? I'm not confused now I realise you're a bargain bin cookbook chef... #MKR
"Katie and Nikki may have been too into themselves, but Kat and Andre are far too into crapping on everyone else #mkr"
#mkr goodbye girls you will be missed
Why is all the excess pastry around the sides of the pans? #mkr
Kat is horrid. HORRID. DIAF. #mkr #mykitchenrules
Must say I would be up for this main #MKR #German
Really hope Kat and Andre get out a 1 is ridiculous #GoHome #DontDeserveToBeThere #MKR
The rosti looks like one massive chip that has been in the fryer too long. It wont be good. #MKR
Bah! Not going to watch My Kitchen Rules anymore #mkr. Lost all credibility with how low everyone scored Katie and Nikki. Senseless viewing.
Pete and Manu like it. Stfu Kat. You are gross. #mkr #mykitchenrules
Even if Kat &amp; Andre gave them the 3 they wanted they still would be there and the blondies still woulda gone home #MKR
Not really a fan of #katieandnikki but would've rather they stayed than #katandandre #mkr
#mkr omg I want that foooooddddd &lt;3 go girls!!
"OMG can't wait to see Kat and Andre royally stuff it up in the challenges, my fingers are already starting to twitch #mkr"
What I have taken from #mkr is that if all you served was a big bowl of crackling for every course you would be nailed on for victory!!
"@mykitchenrules Well, I was under the illusion that this show was about cooking. Turns out its just about who can be the biggest bitch. #mkr"
FFS last year WA had Chloe &amp; Kelly and now we have Kat &amp; Andre. Channel 7 doesn't like Perth haha! #mkr
That is a fucking joke! #mkr
I'm so glad all the instant restaurants are done and Colin is back! Was getting bored #mkr
JFC Kat do you have NO morals???? Carnt #mkr2015 #mkr
If you have to score strategically low to stay in the comp means you can't cook #mkr #feistyfoodies
"@australiacamper Yep, same. But it's also wrong of #Mkr to let them get away with it. #mkr2015"
"Jelly much, Kat? Andre is no catch.  #mkr"
Isn't sauerkraut meant to be fermented cabbage? #MKR
Use ketchup #mkr
I hope you're not #mkr
Those chicken livers look massive. Did they come from foghorn leghorn? #MKR
Colin's back #MKR
Don't like liver #mkr #mkr2015
Omfg Kat. I will cut you for being horrible. Do. Not. #MKR  #mykitchenrules
"Kat is definitely an A GRADE BITCH, but channel 7 will be loving it, she's a ratings puller. Everyone loves to hate her #mkr"
Lloyd likes thing intensely meaty. No surprises there. #MKR
Chicken livers. Do they have chianti? #hannibal #mkr2015 #mkr http://t.co/bYp2nqMtO1
"Don't wish ill #katandandre, Horrible behaviour, disappointed you are from WA!  #evaanddebra all the way #MKR"
"Kat and Andre are bad representatives of Perth. Non WA's, I promise most people in Perth are more like Eva &amp; Debra! #mkr"
PSYCHO EYES. You are a truly horrible person. #mkr #mykitchenrules
Can't believe how nasty #katandandre are! Embarrassed they're representing WA #mkr
Omgosh I hate Kat and Andre from #MKR @mykitchenrules :/
Flirting? Omg staaahhhp. Fug #mkr
Can Kat and Andre shut the fuck up like how selfish are you #MKR
You can't cook..go home Kat and Andre.  Slimy cheating humans.  #embarrasmenttoWA #MKR
Is #mkr turning into #masterchef
Thanks Pete!! Totally don't feel bad about using my fingers to get my food on my spoon now #MKR
"Voting strategically on #mkr is one of the lowest things you can do. You're sitting bottom of the redemption round, clearly not going to win"
Strategy is over now. Nowhere to hide #annieandlloyd #katandandre #mkr
Kat your sour face is repulsive. #mkr #mykitchenrules
WTF is Manu saying. Can't understand him. #MKR
That main course actually looks delicious. I would eat everything but the pork cutlet. #MKR
Just read Joel has left #ImACelebrityAU  :( and Kat and Andre are still in #MKR ?!? Bad outcomes tonight on reality TV tonight. Boo.
"It is called CRACKLING! Stop being pretentious &amp; calling it crackle. 
#MKR"
She is such a bee eye tea see H!!! #mkr #feistyfoodies
So it's fair for kat and Andre to score the girls a 1 even though they deserved more? You kept most hard to watch couple in the comp #mkr
I fucking hate Mkr #mkr
"Hahaha go girl! Take that, Kat #mkr"
Glad I can get back to my life now the fun part of #mkr is over and the faux Masterchef part has started.
Soooo love that Emma made a comment and had a dig at Kats strategic behaviour bout bloody time #mkr
What genius thought that letting teams score their competition was a good idea? Playing really dirty. #MKR
That's fucking low.. You two are pathetic! #mkr
Why don't you just give them a 0 and shut the fuck up #mkr
Maybe if Kat and Andre spent as much time focusing on cooking rather than strategy they'd actually do well  ... #MKR
"Hahaha as if you can talk.. Sorry, what did you do in your first round? #mkr"
Why do the ugly hearted and untalented people always thrive on #mkr. Kat and Andre should've gone home. Such bitter assholes #mykitchenrules
couldn't feel more different about the 2 WA teams. proud as punch of Eva &amp; Debra... just want to punch Kat &amp; Andre. pair of fucktards. #mkr
I've seen vermin more lovable than Kat &amp; Andre. #MKR
"When a shows results are judged by bitchiness and not merit of the meal im not watching anymore, producers STOP the rot #mkr"
Banter #mkr
@Beauthesius Kat is showing her true colours #mkr
Oops typo I meant ONE big bowl of shit #mkr
#mkr hope the girls do good tonight!!
It's TIME... Redemption Round starts NOW WA! #KillerBlondes #MKR http://t.co/ZmM7dfTSLj
@HarryCope3 @MMikhaela - some people don't deserve to be on #mkr!

I'm not a fan of chicken liver.. #Entree :/
#KatieandNikki #MKR"
Literally cannot decide which team I like less. #katandandre vs #katieandnikki #mkr2015 #mkr
It's Kat &amp; Andre vs Katie &amp; Nikki. In the last redemption round instant restaurant who will escape elimination? #MKR http://t.co/8sFlJvuziP
"Tough words, Pete, from someone whose Paleo Cook Book for babies was just pulled due to the possibility of under-nourished babies. #MKR"
I rufuse to watch #mkr after seeing Kat go through to the next round. Forget the food... May the biggest bitch win! @mykitchenrules
My Kitchen Rules #MKR 2015 episode 22 recap: are Kat and Andre beyond redemption? - @SMH_news http://t.co/IaKwsqcqrO
"As much as I was looking forward to the girls getting their comeuppance, I absolutely hate Kat &amp; Andre.. Bloody ridiculous scoring #mkr"
cannot believe kat and andre are still there omfg don't even deserve to be there lol I can't stand them soz not soz #mkr
#MKR For all you pissed about Kat getting through - just think of the twitter fun we are going to have at her expense next round!
Kat your behaviour is appalling and embarrassing soooo glad your not in my family tsk tsk #mkr
Say what you will about the #PromoGirls but their apple pie does sound kick-ass. #MKR
"I was hoping someone would say ""let's get Kat out, we'll score a 10"" #mkr"
"After a spur of the moment roast lamb for 7 its offical, i should apply for #mkr"
"Bitterness is a dish best not served at all, Kat #MKR"
I think I'd rather slightly over cooked pork chop than dishwater fish soup #mkr #FailedFoodies
"Just caught up on #MKR - I think it's safe to say Kat and Andre are the worst. I actually wanted the blondes to stay, &amp; they were no picnic!"
The fact that everyone is hoping Katie and Nikki do well just shows how much Australia hates Kat and Andre #MKR
I didn't even like Katie and Nikki but oh my god kat and Andre need to leave right now. #mkr
Wow new low Kat and Andre #mkr
#katandandre to not score meals on their merits but say it's only fair you stay in the comp is a joke. Karma will come soon #cheats #mkr
"#MKR Kat, you are a dick!"
"Fuck Kat and Andre, what bloody cheats #unaustralian #mkr"
I hope Kat and Andre are eliminated next #mkr I'll make it happen
So Kat and Andre from #mkr just leave a bad taste in your mouth. Very poor losers that's for sure.
"None of this dish makes sense, it's bits and pieces of crap put together to make on big bowl of shit #mkr"
"""The best way to win #mkr2015 #mkr is to cook well,"" said @manufeildel By far an excellent reprimand towards #Kat and #Andre"
I HATE KAT AND FUCKING ANDRE... WHAT A PAIR OF MUTTY UNSPORTSMANLIKE DOGS @mykitchenrules #mkr #evil #biggestbitch #moles #cheaters
@shosking6 @MickFloyd Or hit her with the so called bread she made. That'd knock her out. #mkr

NO KAT IS STILL IN THE COMPETITION GET OUT GET OUT #mkr
"Going through the #MKR tweets, rarely have I seen the C word used so often."
How and why did Kat and Andre make it through?! They're seriously awful. #mkr
Good luck to the people on #mkr
"""This round Manu and I will not be at every challenge. I'm fighting a negated cook book deal in court."" #MKR"

#ThingsBetterThanKatAndAndre ....Kicking my toe is better than Kat and Andre.   #mkr
"Eww, chicken livers?! Yuck.. #mkr"
"Absolutely bullshit that Kat &amp; Andre are going through. They are the most strategic, bitchy couple. #MKR"
"Kat and Andre don't deserve to stay in the competition. It's about good cooking, not """"strategic"""" voting. #mkr #outwiththecheats"
@mykitchenrules Kat and Andre suck. Hope they get eliminated soon. #mkr

And here comes the kitchen HQ crew !!!!#MKR #fourinhand #fourinhandhotel #colinfassnidge https://t.co/dUlLfYUs76
#MKR. Honestly. How can any of them attempt to cook well without at least half a bottle of shiraz in them.
It's not sauerkraut lol!! #mkr
Go girls you got it go gueensland and stop being mean Kat and andre #mkr
"Forgot how many f&amp;$*in wankers are on #MKR

I hope in the next round Kat and Andre catch on fire!!!! #MKR #kat&amp;andre
"Wow 
What a low life cow Kat is  #MKR"
Not going to continue watching #MKR if it's going to be the Kat and Andre show #boring #frustrating
#MKR Kat -_-
Kat &amp; Andre you ONLY got through tonight because of your scoring. Why smile? Means u can't cook u have to cheat. Sad. #mkr
A 1? Are you fuckin serious?! Fair suck of the sav Kat &amp; Andre #MKR
She shall now be known as Sourpuss #MKR #KatAndre #FailedFoodies
@foodtemple if the contestants knew the first thing about food and *then* voted poorly I'd be offended. So NOT a food show anymore. #mkr
"Congratulations Kat, you are now up there with the most hated people in Australia tonight. Pure bitch #MKR"
#MKR and #GoggleboxAU Can both go FUCK them selves!!!
Tonight's My Kitchen Rules elimination was complete bullshit. #mkr
Wow. I really don't like those blondes but I'd like to see Kat go down slowly and painfully. #mkr
"I'm not a fan of the blonde butchers, but those scores seemed awfully low #mkr"
For instant restaurants lowest teams score should be not counted to balance any strategic votes and then it's out of 100 #mkr
"Kat is a disgusting failure Vampire. What a bloody shambles, what a winner. #mkr"
KAT AND ANDRE ARE SO ANNOYING PLS GO HOME #MKR
"A ""1""?????? Hmmmmm #mkr"
"Congratulations Kat and Andre, you came second last #MKR"
Kat you truly are a bitch and the lowest form of a human being. The only saving grace is that the other teams can cook #mkr
Kat and Andre are so awful wtf is wrong with you two? #MKR
Kat and Andre you fucking conniving arseholes !! A fucking one. That's it I'm done you are simply EVIL and not worthy of this show  #MKR
@mykitchenrules I think this year all the action is in the kitchen...not 'the block' #MKR
Not even the roaches &amp; rodents would eat Kat &amp; Andre's food ! #RSPCA #crueltytoanimals #mkr
Kat and Andre are f@&amp;$ing wankers!!! Hope they burn themselves next round! Revenge is a dish best served cold! #mkr #Reallyaone
Kat and Andre are absolute dickheads! #mkr
Love all these people having a go at Kat like she is the only one ever to vote strategically in #MKR history. Happens every year.
So disappointed. Strategic scoring sucks #mkr
Kat &amp; Andre should be disqualified as they're giving people low scores on purpose. #mkr #mkr2015
"Devastated that Kat is still there, wasn't the biggest fan of the blondes but liked them much more than Kat #MKR"
Come on everyone. Kat and Andre are just pulling in the viewers and underneath we just want them to be around to stir everyone up #MKR
She really looks like the Kat that swallowed the canary #mkr #noneedtogloat
Kat and Andre are filthy bastards. #mkr
"The fuck do you know about ""fair"", Kat? #MKR"
@AJBrady_Sports #mkr ??
"What happened in #mkr, i was at indoor soccer"
"Don't know about you but I'm soooo over so called ""strategic"" voting! #MKR #sourgrapes"
"#MKR. Kat, you snake. Even if you win and open your own restaurant. Who's going to go?"
Kat &amp; Andre are a bunch of stupid gutless people. #mkr #wrong
Cat needs to understand that she is a terrible cook and needs to strategically vote herself out of the competition #mkr
#MKR. A one? Kat and Andre. How does it feel to be the most despised people in Australia?
Kat and Andre...drown yourself #MKR #mkr2015
How the fuck did Kat and Andre get thru #mkr
Kat + Andre = RETARDS  #mkr
#MKR that's appauling. You give a 1 if they serve vegemite toast
Kat and Andre are making me mad. Wanna kick them in the face. Every waking minute. Andre is a fuckheads name. Kat- you are a feral mole #mkr
I don't want #MKR to end!
I think Annie is on sleeping medication or something. #mkr
"I don't know if I'm happy or not... On one hand I really don't like the promo girls. On the other... Well, we're all thinking it... #MKR"
Kat and Andre don't deserve it hope they destroy them in the group rounds #mkr
Voting strategically is logical (if coldblooded). It's a fault in the show that people can turn to it. Drama sells. #mkr #katandandre
Whatever. I want to see what cringe worthy moments Kat &amp; Andre produce out in challenges. It'll be amazing #MKR
Those 2 cheats that gave the girls a 1. Should be chucked off the show #MKR
"You bloody arseholes Kat and Andre, to score that low is absolutely BS #MKR"
"I wished Kat and Andre would have left. Damn it, I can't stand them. #MKR"
Oh god no... #mkr
Kat &amp; Andre the only ones in history to give a 1 and all for strategy! You don't deserve to be in the competition!!!! #mkr #losers
Kat and Andre make me want to throw my TV at their fucking conceited heads. Fucking cunts. Die. #mkr
Kat and Andre are awful giving a 1 #MKR
"@stillerhappy so disappointed. I wasn't the biggest fan of the blondes, but liked them so much more than Kat #MKR"
Who else is looking forward to Kat and Andre's pending elimination #mkr
"Umm that's actually so fucked! Kat and Andre suck hair balls they should of gone, they can't cook &amp; they are fucking bitches #mkr"
"If Katie &amp; Nikki go, I hope one of them give Kat a left hook on the way out. What a bitch. #mkr"
#mkr I love Annie and loyld there like a real life Disney couple it's so adorable
#mkr why would anyone want to eat chicken liver that's just ew no
Everybody hates you Kat!!! Shut the fuck up!!! #MKR
#asskickery hahahahaha #mkr #mkr2015 #mkrsexylloyd
"#mkr Kat says ""we're last because everyone scored us strategically"" Manu says ""the way to win is cook good food"" meaning your food was shit!"
For the next episode of #MKR - Kat is going to serve up boiled bunny!  #Psycho #FatalAttraction
I didn't like Katie and Nikki but i wished it was Kat and Andre that were leaving #mkr
"My fav #MKR teams so far are definitely: 
Eva &amp; Debra
Rose &amp; Josh 
Annie &amp; Loyd 
Robert &amp; Lynzy
Sherie &amp; Emilie 
Jaz &amp; Shaz (not in order)"
"#mkr ""we cook all the time"" yup they cook so much they don't know how to use a can opener"
#mkr can't believe no one knows the difference between  sauerkraut  and  red  cabbage. Sauerkraut is pickled cabbage people!!!!!
"Well done Kat.. you literally cheated your way in... yeah, go you... You'll be out the first time you have to cook against real cooks #MKR"
#mkr if you were bottom of the table... Twice in one season... Answers all questions I reckon. #mkr2015
Andre you fucking whipped cunt!! Arghhhhh #mkr #deathtokat
I now officially hate Kat and Andre I hope karma bites them hard. #mkr
Where is da SOSE ? Wood of lyked Moore  #mkr
"That awkward moment when Kat and Andre use the word ""fair"" in a sentence. Do you even know what that means?? #mkr"
I never thought I would say that I wanted the 2 blondes to stay on #mkr.    But Kat and Andre are mean and nasty: makes me not want to watch
I would slap the smirk off Kat's face  #MKR
I really want that pork crackling #mkr
#mkr the way she flirts with the young boys at Coles........Ohhh no
Ew Kat and Andre are still in the comp. #MKR
@sharonpiggott Um. It's birthday week. Your week to be CLASSY. Why are you tweeting about #MKR? #festivalofsharon
Bottom two should've gone!  #mkr
get rekted Kat and Andre #mkr
Kat and Andre did not appear once in the preview of the next round of the comp. Gone early? Hope so. Yay. #mkr
"Kat&amp;Andre Monday: ""People have voted strategically, how rude!!"" Kat&amp;Andre tonight: Votes strategically for the third time in the comp. #mkr"
#MKR  as much as I dislike them. That dessert does look good.
#mkr the way kat looks at Annie is like she's stearing into her soul it's just creepy
Redemption round  ( thank goodness ) and home made restaurant cooking is over ...no where to hide now . #mkr
"When nobody strategically scores you,  yet your bottom of the comp table Hahaha #mkr #mkr2015"
Watched one more time to see if Kat and Andre had managed to stop being awful people. No. Not even after Manu warned them. Bye bye #mkr
@LynneMcGranger Kat and Andre are a disgrace! They should be booted. To score that low to save themselves.....pffft! #mkr
Deconstructed Apple pie...bwilliant #mkr
"So useless, didn't even finish that episode of #mkr might have to leave catching up for the weekend"
Kat and Andre staying is possibly the worst thing to happen on the show ever #mkr
#katandandre #absolutetwats #mkr2015 #mkr why would you be such dicks!
I watched #MKR tonight...  Kat and Andre should be disgusted with themselves...  Uncalled for on so many levels...
I want to give Kat some moisturiser #MKR
"#mkr omg the kiss stains on the ""dirty"" mirror is sooo tacky!! Oh my god"
And since the 2015 premiere #mkr has been on for 36 hours already in total with the extension of all episodes to 90 minutes.
#MKR that ain't Sauerkraut!  It's RoteKohl .....
#mkr I can't believe it http://t.co/CIicHpm58i
#mkr Awww no modelling tonight? #ThankGod
OMG your behaviour is so embarrassing.. I wonder what your family thinks of you Kat?  I'd be totally ashamed of you... #MKR
"@mykitchenrules Why does everyone say they are ""voting strategically"", rather than being honest and saying they are blatantly cheating. #mkr"
Are Kat and What's his face paid actors? Surely people can't be THAT negative all the time.  #mkr
Kat is such a witch! Someone throw water on her! #mkr
#MKR Kat and Andre must be feeling so f.....d at this stage. It really doesn't matter what they say.
"Kat, ugliness exudes from within hence a reflection in ones physical appearance. Lighten up girlfriend! #mkr #mkr2015"
"I would love for someone to ""ACCIDENTLY"" spill a pot of boiling water on Kats head. #CuntAndAndre #MKR worst humans/cooks ever on the show"
"What's with Petes face, looks like he's been varnished  #MKR"
@MKR_Official I hope Kat and Andre die in a kitchen fire next time they cook #cheats #MKR
Hahahaha thank you @manufeildel .... #Kat&amp;Andre I advise that you apply water to the burned area of your dignity #mkr http://t.co/FdV3livN6R
That pastry looks awful!! #MKR
"#mkr kat is gonna score low for one 
1.there last 
2. She's crazy"
SNAP Manu - best judge reply on #MKR that ur bad score is because of strategic voting.....do they realize they have to cook good well too?
"And a collective ""FUCK YOU"" arises from across the country. Kat, you won't last 5 minutes against the other teams #mkr2015 #MKR"
Watching #mkr gotta love my cooking shows
Kat is the biggest bitch I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in my life. #MKR
"What a disgraceful episode of MKR, hope kat and Andre fail and that smirk is wiped off their face. #strategicbullshit #katandandresuck #mkr"
"#MKR  look at Kat and Andre. They're hoping that dessert is a festering, pussie boil."
"Kat you've been owned: ""there's only one way to stay in this competition - cook good food"" (Manu) #mkr #feistyfoodies"
I was so happy to hear Manu take that dig... clearly the message didn't sink in... #Disgraceful Kat&amp;Andre #MKR
@helenaandvikki have you guys picked your winners for this year? Any bets? #MKR
#mkr those carrots look overdone
"Wait, I thought #MKR was about the cooking? Why isn't anyone talking about the well cooked chicken livers?"
Can't decide if I dislike the 'promo' girls more than I dislike Kat &amp; Andre. Either way one of them is gone tonight. WINNING! #mkr2015 #MKR
Perhaps next season all scores get revealed at the end of each round?Then ppl like Kat &amp; Andre can't strategically score? #disgusting #mkr
Kat didn't like the canoodles.... #mkr #mkr2015
Strategic or Talentless Hack? You be the judge #mkr
#mkr I'm out people. Going to @Mr_Fanta_Pants to drown my sorrows in roofied Fanta! Night!
"@xwickedmindx It's so difficult to choose between the two teams, isn't it! Despicable behaviour, much? Bah. #MKR"
"Stop calling it ""being strategic"" when really it is ""being shameless dirtbags"" #mkr"
#MKR Katie.. trusting your instincts is like trusting the instincts of  the Titanic Captain.
Hope Katie&amp;Nikki make it just 2take out Kat&amp;Andre #MKR
#MKR can't wait to have Robert &amp; Lynzey back!
Thought Jane was safe with the score of 92. Did they forget or I missed the announcement ? #mkr
@LiveTweetsAU Go Sassy Girls!!! Made that Apple Pie KICKASS!!! :D #mkr
#mkr aahhh that pork looks ssoooo good.
@mykitchenrules My crap tastes better than the shit Kat &amp; Andre served up. I wouldn't feed it to a dead cat. #villans #cheats #mkr #mkr2015
"Kat and Andre are behaving in such a spiteful, vindictive manner. Who do they think they are - #MKR contestants?"
"I can barely tolerate Kat and Andre, Katie and Nikki are annoying but I'd rather see them than Kat and Andre #mkr"
I wish Annie would stand up and punch Kat in the face. #mkr
"I would try the main course, but I would never touch the liver from the entree #MKR"
Anyone eliminated yet?  #mkr
@dan_cake or you could just stop watching crap like #mkr.
I want Sheri &amp; Emilie to have their own show. With special appearances from Annie &amp; Lloyd. #MKR
What a cunt of a person Kat is #MKR
#MKR why are all tonight's contestants dressed like they are going on dancing with the Stars?
Sheri &amp; Emilie are the cutest whilst Kat &amp; Andre are the most vile. #mkr
@mykitchenrules kat is a whench boot her off #mkr
"#MKR No sauce for your Pork, Lloyd will be so upset, he loves a sauce with his pork"
Is there something wrong with me? I really like Kat and Andre haha #mkr
@tiahnwright I disliked Annie and Lloyd more. #mkr
@EmilySymons_ @LynneMcGranger Not happy wanted the girls to win.#mkr
the world would be a better place if Kat and Andre left the show #MKR
"@allankmelb Surely when you go to a restaurant you have certain expectations, given what is written on the menu? #MKR"
At least Katie &amp; Vikki can cook Garlic ! Bonus  #mkr
#mkr  Unbelievable how low Kat &amp; Andre will go. Despicable couple. Can't believe how disgusted I am in their behavior.
@stweet_heart CRACKLING people #mkr

Hope these girls do good really don't want them to go #mkr make your main and dessert amazing girls
#MKR The bimbos make an awesomely awesome kick ass awesome apple awesome pie. Which has to be perfectly awesome or they'll go home. Awesome!
"If 2 #mkr contestants were to be ousted by Kat &amp; Andre's unfair score, Nikki &amp; Kate were the right ones. Didn't cook well, almost as bitchy"
The dessert looked great!  I wouldn't have cooked the apples like that... but I want to try that icecream!  #MKR

"If you want to win, you win by cooking good food not by sabotaging other people, that's not a win that's cheating, Kat &amp; Andre suck #MKR"
Urgh.. that's just naff... a ONE?  #shameshameshame #MKR
Not strategic; just being an A*hole. Calling it something else doesn't make it ok. #mkr
14 couples remain on #mkr. Means if one team is booted out every week and two in semi finals then show will finish mid May.
they are complaining that it's taking too long. typical of andre and kat #mkr
#MKR Kat &amp; Andre. Congratulations. You've just won a one way trip to mars.
"#MKR What's with all the ""It's not what we were expecting."" Judge what's put in front of you, not what you think should have been supplied."
Why the freakin hell do Katie &amp; Vikki puree everything ? #mkr

Rigged #MKR #KatTheRat
"On the other hand, you can argue that if strategic scoring wasn't invoked - Katie &amp; Nikki still fell short with their menu to stay #MKR"
My only problem is there are worst cooks then captain Salty #mkr
"Super excited for the new challenges. Goosies, and its only the trailer. Yayyy! Tomorrow! #MKR"
They clearly aren't even trying to hide how rigged it is anymore.The girls should have stayed but Kat's more controversial.#mkr
Katie &amp; Vikki have requested a Breville Sandwich maker to be added to the kitchen at MKR head quarters #technicallychallenged #mkr
#MKR there are more people left in this competition than probably live in Mount Isa
Arrgh my hearties we get to see Captain Salty farm more salt Thursday and her trusty gimp I mean first mate do nothing at all #mkr
"#mkr scoring is ridiculous. ""Liked 80% of it so only giving a 4"" #snakes"
Who are all these people? I've forgotten #mkr
@mykitchenrules #mkr please kick off that lady who is such a rude person. She has such a crappy attitude towards the others. Shes gave a one
"Strategic voting in a cooking competition will only get you so far, when you are an oxygen thief that cannot cook. #mkr"
"#MKR Kat I don't like anything on tonight's menu, well go back to Hungry Jacks then or eat the shit u served up the other night"
kat gives me the absolute shits #mkr
It's for toasting sandwiches not cooking potatoes for head chefs!!!! #mkr
Hoping editing might be to blame but srsly #katandandre need to check themselves! Can't wait till they're out cooked by the other teams #MKR
"There seems to be 2 ways to succeed in #mkr cook terribly, whinge excessively about not getting a fair go and give 1's or u know, cook well"
Tonight's #mkr result proves that smug arseholes can prosper #mkr2015
Haha aaannndd Thats why i love you  @manufeildel #mkr
Exciting times on #MKR - just 67 teams left
"I hope their cooking shows through the next round. I mean, they have to plate it up right? All their (lacking) skills. #MKR"
"If you had an ounce of self respect, you'd accept that you have room to improve. Kat and Andre, you're so disappointing. 
#MKR"
"Kat's absolutely delusional if she thinks it was ""strategic scoring"" that put them on the bottom of the leaderboard!! #MKR @MyVancouver"
Gotta get home to watch #mkr
Kat and Andre are horrible people who do not deserve to still be in this competition #mkr
Kat's face..the only thing worse than her cooking #MKR
"And here are the tears. Get over it, you didn't do a good job. Stop blaming strategic voting. #mkr"
I've been sucked into the trap once again thinking this show *isn't* rigged when it obviously is #mkr
On a lighter note... Yay! No more instant restaurants!!! #MKR
Miss @arna_jane I think you'd get on very well with @missclarolyn seeing you both loooooove #MKR

It's totally amazing how people make an ass of themselves on #MKR
"Worst!! Actually wanted to throw my remote at my tv after that score!! Shitty strategic score you witch!! #Cheats #UnfairScore

#MKR"
Good news is Kat and Andre aren't shown in the promo ads...  #mkr
#MKR I think we can all agree that cooking was the winner
#mkr kat and andre didn't vote fairly they don't deserve to win.
Great comeback Manu. Cook some good food next time Kat and Andre #mkr
Time to saddle up... #MKR
"as of now, favorite teams on #MKR would have to be Eva &amp; Debra and Will &amp; Steve. least favorite would definitely be Kat and Andre"
I don't like wishing ppl bad luck but gosh I really dislike Kat and Andre. Much worse than tennis man! #mkr
Promo looks promising. Pls say their absence means the #FauxFoodies R the 1st couple eliminated in the next round! UGH. #CantStandThem #mkr
Logie for most disgusting person on tv - Kat - so much joy in winning by playing unfairly #mkr
@mykitchenrules pathetic Channel 7 #mkr

@Kristinaa_Egger I hope Eva and Debra win the competition #MKR
Happy to watch my last episode of #mkr  fucken over it
Why you always make my cry #mkr? Why?
#mkr Well too say I'm pissed off at that result would be an understatement. But I'm confident we won't have Kandre for long. Can't cook.
"Kat the Rat

#MKR"
Next to be eliminated needs to be Kat &amp; Andre for sure!! #MKR #theyneedtogo #cannotwait
So I just basically started #MKR. Why are they serving chicken livers? Vomit!
The truth behind another elimination round...to get rid of #cuntandandre #mkr
I enjoy #mkr for the cooking not to watch feral human behaviour; Kats gotta go
"The good news is, I did not see one screen grab in future #MKR grab bag of eps."
"Sorry to say that the real compitition has begun Katie and Andre, but do you have the gumption? #MKR"
Everyone's back!!! This is awesome. Can't wait to see what they are going to do this year #MKR
Looks like we are in for an emotional rollercoaster. Going to be great!!! #MKR
They'll be back in The Never Say Die Never Say Never Again round. #mkr
That's really low.  #MKR
Kat and Andre are such revolting human beings! #MKR
Don't fuck with me I fucking despise Kat and Andre fuck off #mkr
#mkr is closed! Hooray for the end of instant restaurants and time to head to Kitchen HQ for challenges! We asked for change and got it!
"With all this bitchiness, I had forgotten about the Texan! Thank god he's back #MKR"
#MKR Kat &amp; Andre seem to have some very strong feelings against strategic scoring....until they decide to engage.  Two horrible people!
Get some more fucking teams why doncha? #mkr
Yay! Colin is back! #MKR
Fast snatch is back. Surprise. #mkr
"I'm glad Will and Steve are back, though. #MKR #MKR2015"
I'M SO MAD #MKR
"Will, Steve and Roberts accent always get to me #mkr"
#mkr not watching this show now that Kat and Andre are through. Pathetic people with no dignity whatsoever @mykitchenrules
#mkr Kat &amp; Andre are the real losers
"#mkr If I had immunity, I'd cook poo sausage."
#MKR did they even have chickens back in caveman times Pete?
So how many teams are we 'starting' with now? #mkr
Damn you Kat &amp; Andre! Hope karma comes around and bites you in the arse!!! #mkr
Can someone get that homeless Irish guy a jacket that fits? #mkr
Our favourite teams pushed to the limit. So Kat and Andre will have to cook weetbix and milk then. #mkr
What the actual fuck???? Are they saying there are no more instant restaurant rounds??? I feel ripped off there were only 23 rounds... #MKR
No more instant restaurants? #MKR
How is the deadbeat Dad/tennis coach/friend of the judges still in this show??? #mkr
"you all respect him...you respect him, right? right? #mkr"
#mkr i noticed Kat and Andre weren't in any of those upcoming clips. hehehehehee
"ah, #ashandcamilla are back,  #mkr"
I hope Kat and Andre's kitchen burns down! Un-Australian their tactics! They can't be happy with that! #flogs #mkr
Thank god. Now the real show can start! #MKR #MKR2015
There is a very valid case to be made that strategic scoring by multiple teams impacted the elimination tonight #MKR
#mkr #katmkr http://t.co/vLYkzY5p7D
Colin is back! #MKR
I have a feeling this will be Pete's last season and Colin will replace him. Goodbye paleo bullshit. #MKR
What??? How along are they dragging this show on for? #suchathingastoomuch #mkr
How to Kat and Andre keep escaping elimination?! Definitely don't think they're #MKR worthy...we'll have see how it goes
#MKR Lloyds happy with all this meat on tonight's menu
Bless I totally forgot about the party favourite Shaz... #MKR
Kat &amp; Andre definitely do not deserve to be still in the competition. I'm disappointed once again! #MKR
Kat and andre should be sent home for cheating...twice! #mkr absolute bullshit... they should not see the scores until the end of the show!
"Pretty much how I'm feeling at the end of #mkr. Hope that mole from WA goes ASAP! @LynneMcGranger, surely you agree? http://t.co/Izb3n6KHU5"

Oh really? No more instant restaurants? THAT'S SHOCKING. #MKR #MKR2015
Wait.. Who respects Colin...  #mkr
The homeless man is back #mkr #coln
Outrageous! What awful people. I hope they are gone in the very next elimination. #mkr
Great to see Colin just got out of bed for this get together. #mkr
How did that just happen? It was clear they cooked better food! Seriously fuck #mkr

"Not a big #MKR fan, but foul play from Kat and Andre! Wow that's poor form"
Kat and Andre fuck up you're both oxygen thiefs #mkr @mykitchenrules
Cannot believe they made it through. Are they just going to give everyone a 1 for the rest of the comp? #feistyfoodies #mkr @mykitchenrules
#kandre are so vile I actually feel sorry for the #killerblondes #mkr
"Oh my god I can not handle one more ep of Kat and Andre, they are cooking my nut, big time #MKR"
I really dislike Kat &amp; Andre. #mkr #firstroundexit
#MKR the teams all gave crap scores aside from the Melbourne girls. Ridiculous. Kat and Andre shouldn't stay in the competition.
As if Kat and Andre were going to score higher than a 1 anyway... #MKR #MKR2015 #mykitchenrules #ugh @mykitchenrules
#mkr don't be scared of Colin. don't forget - you're holding the knives.
TOP 4 get safety from elimination!!! #MKR
I miss robert's voice. #mkr
Eugh piss off kat #mkr
I am so sick of seeing pork crackling on #MKR. Time to do something different people. Actually I am pretty sick of MKR.
"Kat and Andre, I really hope you are eliminated next  #mkr #feistyfoodies #badsports"
"Can Kat and Andre(a) just fuck off, they're shit people and even worse ""cooks"" #mkr"
Back to handing out sausage rolls on toothpicks at Woolies #mkr
everytime someone scores strategically i come closer to throwing something at my tv it is cheating omfg #mkr
Kat and Andre should get out in the next round..shameless  #mkr
I really hope Kat and Andre fail in the most spectacularly and humiliating manner possible. Thoroughly horrible people. #mkr
Kat and Andre can fuck right off. #MKR
Oh and the unhygienic greaseball returns #mkr
wow did not see that coming #mkr
Kat and Andre must be pretty fucking shit cooks if you need to vote a team 1! #mkr2015 #mkr

Pete Evans looks orange #mkr
If #mkr had any integrity they would disqualify Kat and Andre for strategic scoring #MKR
"And the Producers rejoice. ""More twitter rage for Kat! Hooray! Ratings!"" #mkr"
Yay Robert is back! #MKR
"Seriously, I would fucking picket Kat and Andre's restaurant. Outrageous behaviour. #MKR"

'Australia's favourites are back'? Uhh.... what?! #MKR
"Ugh, get out. #mkr"
"Just so the results, why would the other teams not up the score to drop kick Captain Salty and her first mate beta? #mkr"
Our judges are about to turn the heat up in the competition! What do you think is in store for our remaining teams? #mkr
So all #mkr contestants shop at the same doorbell store ??
"So, that's a big double announcement for #mkr! What does everyone think?"
I feel the need to throw something at the tv. Kat doesn't deserve to go through. #MKR #bitch
Ok I officially dislike Kat the most #mkr
Don't understand how bad sportsmanship can be condoned by #mkr #strategicscoring
You won't last long Kat and Andre... Others there can cook...  #mkr
Kat and Andre do not deserve to be in the competition #dogs #mkr
How hard is it to be humble?  #MKR

Kat survived? Is this real life? #mkr
Good bye MKR. Kat and Andre have turned me off this vile show now #mkr

Fuck Kat and Andre they are next to go!!  #MKR

They should feel embarrassed by their behaviour. Everyone played fair but those #FauxFoodies #DontDeserve2beThere #mkr
Who is good at maths? What do they need to be safe? #MKR
Can they just send Kat and Andre home anyway because they're rude and annoying and score everyone strategically  #MKR
#MKR Ladies. Manu is not excited about the prospect of your entree. He's excited about the prospect of you going home.
Hurry up! Kat and Andre are dicks #mkr
Kat and Andre are now more hated than Adam and Carol. #mkr
Did I hear the guests gave 17? If so that's quite a joke. #mkr
I actually don't like crackling. #MKR
Oh well. They have no chance of winning anyway. Good luck you idiots #mkr

For fuck sake Annie. Sort out that disgusting blush. Enough is enough. #MKR
NOOOOOO!!!!! Kat &amp; Andre survive!!!! #mkr
"""The pastry was a little too tall"" #mkr"

But... I don't ever want to see or hear Kat again. Ever. #MKR
I blame the other teams for this. #mkr
Really can't believe I'm still watching this shit!! #mkr
And so we say goodbye to the little butcher girls #mkr
"Ok I'm done. That mole got through, outrageous #mkr"

All Kat and Andre did was cut up bread and layer it with ham and cheese and they can't even get that right seriously they need to go #mkr
What do you think of the two teams facing Sudden Death on Monday? #mkr #suddendeath
So if sherie/Emilie are not the worst they're safe whew #MKR

"#mkr how many times does karma have to slap you in the face till you realise you can't cook, Kat and Andre?"
Kat and Andre are so so mean. #mkr
Those poor #mkr contestants having to camp &amp; cook for 200 for breakfast. Camping! Putting up a tent! Not staying in a cabin. Camping! Yuck!

Fingers crossed Kat &amp; Andre go into sudden death - where they belong! #mkr #katandandre

Why didn't any of the teams serve up cold pizza as a breakfast item? #mkr
Prob not breakfasting the Paleo diet Pete but it's right up there with Pizza in my breakfast book! #MKR
An Annie/Lloyd vs Kat/Andre elimination cook off would be....oh God....please let this happen.  #mkr
#MKR There are more crap dishes than good ones - oh that's right - it's My Kitchen Rules. Silly me.
"Colin is such a dag, I actually love him (I said I wasn't gonna watch anymore but..... COLIN) #mkr"

Blech on the raw eggs... should have just left it to cook longer...  #MKR
Burnt rissoles for breaky. It's a crime against cooking! #mkr
Judges comments are so funny! #mkr

I really hope the bottom two are Kat &amp; Andre and Annie &amp; Lloyd #MKR
Not all Greeks are obese #mkr

You don't suck Sheri and Emilie #DontLetTheBehaviourOfOthersGetYouDown #mkr
'It's a crime against cooking' the shade #mkr
Great to see the local National Park workers tucking into a free feed.  How about you empty those loo's instead. #MKR
I'm sure opening the bbq to let all the hot air out will make it cook faster. #mkr
Where's Manu? Did I miss something at the beginning of the show? #mkr
Bottom 2 teams. I'm thinking Kat and Andre and Annie and Lloyd #mkr
I can't believe people are still surprised that Annie and Lloyd can't cook! #mkr
I don't think those meatballs would do any better in a Library or in Disneyland or any place really. #mkr
Annie is giving Rob a run for his money in the silly hat competition. #mkr
Can Kat and Andre go already? #theycantcook #MKR
#MKR 'There's a police boat over there - this is a crime against cooking' - ok I fully approve now of Colin being a judge!
"Hold the phone. Kat &amp; Andre cook crap again, and think its amazing. #mkr"

"Pancakes all the way, hands down.. Winner.. #mkr"
#RobandDave &amp; #AshandCamilla are the strongest contenders so far. Will the campers agree with the judges? #MKR #tvweekmag

"#MKR yes, bacon for breakfast, what a terrible idea"
That looks bad #MKR

There's a cave nearby where Colin keeps his stuff #mkr
#MKR Stuff that - just buy the dam tortillas and make the breakfast absolutely delicious. Not points for making your own in my eyes.
"Want to play marbles, kids? Go see Annie and Lloyd. #mkr"
There is such a diff between reality &amp; what certain contestants think of their cooking #MKR
#MKR Mmmmm raw egg....

Isn't that the point Pete? Appeal to the public? #MKR
Can't wait to see the winners #mkr

"Gather round, kids. It's story time, brought to you by my good friend @jcmanous."
"Words were said. The gaters protested ""free speech!"" - alas, speech may be free, but not of consequences."
@sunkensomething I... I thought you were being snarky...
Pulling on my lip rings to freak out my mom.
"I have so many ideas and so little time, even doing this full time. 90% of what I'm doing is talking to people."
"@Veeren_Jubbal right??? I love yelling about things I don't like. But now people are listening, and it's this weird responsibility."
"@Caspasia_Boleyn uh, yeah. He's my stepdad. Thanks for the call out, though."
".@NotAllBhas @sydneyparkerr ""I watched 4 episodes of In Living Color I AM KINDA AN EXPERT, GAWD"" *hairflip*"
"@alain_vde a one time donation is still very appreciated ;) I'll give them that feedback, though."
"I was looking for a specific video by @femfreq so I searched ""Anita Sarkeesian"" on YouTube. Good grief. So many angry manchildren."
Well. That makes sense. http://t.co/NNobjH6Q5V
@Caspasia_Boleyn and what a judgmental ass you are. Kindly go fuck yourself. :)
@JimmyGeekPA @srhbutts leo sleeps in my bed in the winter. He's the little spoon.
I'm getting too many friend reqs from people I don't know. I'd rather just manage a page and keep all that stuff separate from pics of leo.
@ThatSabineGirl @MeLectable wrote me the most hilarious open letter that was all about her. I loled for days. Forgot all abt that until now.
"Given that my friend is quite fit and these gaters were not, they quickly departed at the next stop, instead of ""debating"" further."
Not looking for FTE outside of my anti-harassment org ;) @sebkha
OMG pothead stepdad with MS is a sweetheart but I might kill him if he stumbles one more time through this living room where I'm sleeping.
@girlziplocked @DoubleUnionSF I have... a whiteboard. And a mental list that I run through several times a day. I don't know PM stuff yet.
@sschinke @Blackamazon @shanley also sorta working with Twitter on a bunch of things. Will get clarity on NDA.
"@bryneaux I am allergic to cats, but thanks anyways :)"
"I remain optimistic about @twitter and acknowledge that this is a complex problem with no easy solution. Less hate, more ideas, please."
@alain_vde patron?
@Sir5000 she auto follows back
Is that weird? Am I doing the right thing? It feels so pseudo-celeb.
I would hate to have you bug your parents for their credit card. @EunByuLLoL
"@nebrius are the responses bad? I've got the block list enabled, so I see nothing."
It sure is weird how I only ever see mean things being attached to the gamergate hashtag.
@srhbutts wait. When did I become a pedozoophile and what is that?
@DennisCEarl no worries
He is not all there. And I guess he keeps forgetting that the dog just went outside and ughhhh I want to sleep.
@ncoghlan_dev @srhbutts I hate cats.
"I think I need to make a Facebook page, too. UGH. So weird. All of it. I am still coming to terms with this being my life."
".@El_Duce_Rises you're right. They are! Show me where it says ""drugs"" and not ""failure to appear for expired tags"""
"I'm slowly finding people that I trust, but it's all so hard because I care *so much*."
I will burn the building down.
".@WestCoastAnime yes, I found it ;)"
@alexlifschitz @tha_rami for non game dev stuff though? I want something I can hand off as easy explanations for press.
"@didlix @WhyGamerHQ sure! Shoot me an email, randi@randi.io"
@SSTwinrova I need to sit down with one and figure out how to be a better PM at my life. ;)
I'm not important. The things I'm working on are. The people helping me push this are. I don't want the message being warped to be about me.
@Trunthepaige @RissaDueling @Spacekatgal lol. suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure.
"@alain_vde oh, weird. I'm surprised it didn't offer Twitter."
@ThatSabineGirl @MeLectable and then she kept sending all these weird threats my way. Like wicked witch of the west style.
"My mom handed me a book of coupons for buying bras.

I love my family, but I am leaving tomorrow :P"
"Take heed, gaters. You're alone in the world in your campaign of hate. People will stand up to you. Men and women will stand up to you."
"@slagkick @Void_Liminality he's pretty chill. Super sick, though. Multiple sclerosis which is why he's always stoned."
"@SSTwinrova I'm still at the stage where I've given up on finding a good task list mgt app that fits with my workflow, so I use a notepad."
Watching devil wears prada just reaffirms my desire to be single forever. Needy boyfriend omfg.
@nebrius I think so :(
http://t.co/NXgtqSlchG
"At this rate, I'm going to be making slides for a keynote in my car as I drive home."
@gevmage yup. Especially since I start a 14 hour drive home in the morning.
ur face is classified as a utility by the FCC.
I didn't think there were any of those people left...
@InfiniteClock I get 20+ a day. Mostly from Indian people. No clue why.
@MaxxieBytes @NotAllBhas (hilarious side note: that show was my only sighting of a PoC until I was 15. Backwoods farm country. Saw 1 ep.)
"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, in the great state of Georgia, yours truly worked with @jcmanous."
"... when he hears ""blue haired bitch"", ""gamergate"", and ""freebsdgirl"". Oh, dear."
"@ThatSabineGirl wtf does ""identity-sure"" mean? I've never heard this, but it makes it sound like she thinks trans are confused?"
@slagkick I didn't acknowledge the fart I DONT KNOW
@MorseLyA hehe. That was actually super helpful! I'm saving for later so I can review and think about it.
My stepdad walked into the room to offer me pot (WA!) and then he farted for 5 seconds when I declined.
"@AllanSchumacher @tha_rami yeah, this is more activist specific. Less time talking to press, more time writing code."
"@ThatSabineGirl LOL I remember @MeLectable - watch out, she's full gamergate nuts."
"Maybe I should put together a press kit.

What is a press kit? How do I build one?"
@girlziplocked @DoubleUnionSF the difficulty is finding time to find those allies while figuring out what to do with the ones I've got.
"@Veeren_Jubbal YES! I'm like, I have no idea what I am doing most of the time. If I'm an inspiration, we're all fucked."
@BonsaiTreehouse @srhbutts I was never a part of that...
My job gives me a constant stream of endorphins.
@randi_ebooks bot fight
@girlziplocked @DoubleUnionSF not yet. I should.
@almafeta I think women in general have issues talking about money for activism. Lots of articles on this.
"This brings us to today, when the hero of this story, @jcmanous, was on a bus near UGA. Listening to his podcasts, doing his thing..."
@shanley #killallmen
Weeeee. That's what I get for grumping/joking about a family member. Random internet rage. http://t.co/wIXP48clwv
It's not a bad thing. It's just such a huge change from being a sometimes-FOSS dev &amp; full-time devops to... whatever this is.
a kickstarter is tempting. but I'm just so weird about money. I still feel kind of squick about my patron tbh. blame FOSS mentality.
@freedominguez I saw. :) I've been working directly with twitter's safety department. I have faith they want to do the right thing.
LRT did not appear to be snark. o_O.  Pretty sure dude was serious.
"We parted ways, but stayed in touch throughout the years. He got swole while I went off and did my thing, writing Perl, angering trolls."

@amboy00 I'm waiting for one. But mostly I'm watching the timelines of those involved.
"The number of emails attributing my RTs of WoC/racial issues to ""spoiled white girl guilt"" is now greater than 0."

"I was planning on stopping by Portland again, but I don't think I'm going to have the time for that. Too much to do when I get back."
@MaslabDroid @gamerfortruth possibly
@Heronymus @oscon I submitted for CFP while I was at a bar. Hopefully I get accepted!

"@Bard_of_peace you should be able to criticize me as long as it isn't abusive. People may argue, but criticism is important."
@dromerstein gross
"@Bard_of_peace it's difficult sometimes and not always well received when under heavy attack. Sometimes, I just can't tell what's a troll"
@AntonSirius @erinspice @prpltnkr @ChiefElk oh dear lord.

@hownowgobbycow @KaitlynBurnell I hate math but I strongly appreciate anyone else good at math.
@scaryjen @Kirtaner @DigiRanger1994 we aren't gamergate. We don't do shit like this.
@Bard_of_peace I think I need to get back to sleep now but thanks for having this talk with me :)
@albertinho can't tell if sarcasm or clueless
"@Bard_of_peace it helps remembering how many eyes are watching - not GG, but MSM, people I admire, companies. The NPO depends on me."
"@Bard_of_peace ugh, no kidding. I miss being able to be an asshole, terrible as that is. I still let it out, but everything in moderation."
@mrbowers yes
"@Bard_of_peace if you have ideas, I'd love to hear them. All I know how to offer is - If you get lots of shit, let me know?"

Anyone have a video of this?
"Yay, a new reason for people to hate me. Shove off."
@SubmerseChill what mock account?
@MarcMThompson not once we get it shut down ^.^
@Bard_of_peace but those tweets worry me. I don't want people thinking that. And I'm not sure how to fix it.
I'll likely be back up in the PNW for conference season.
"I like to think that feminists can do feminism however they want,
I don't judge. But if your feminism shits on WoC, it's not feminism."
"@SubmerseChill oh, I RTed and insta-blocked it."

"@drakino sorry I didn't get a chance to stop by. I would've loved to, but I ended up having to go home quicker than I thought."
@Bard_of_peace indeed. Some people are perhaps a bit more protective in that regards than I would like.

"@JimmyMcCunty @Spacekatgal oh, darn, you can't? shoot."

"it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?"
@p8952_ @mjg59 the fact that twitter makes it easier to interact with those you're not connected to may have more to do with this.
"@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch."

literally #devops
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.
@ctmf they are already setting up  bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.
@informationchef i haven't really had to go plonking around in graphite before. this stuff is practically a foreign language.
"Been doing things. Going to have some pretty automated stuff to show you all soon, but for now, some kinda neat stuff I found."
@davidsgallant @Spacekatgal not enough data to know for certain. just what i'm seeing today. she's getting a pretty steady level since then
@BlackGirlDanger cigarette trousers?
@onebrightlight they made mistakes in the past. i hope they've learned. but the way they treated the GG situation has been outstanding.
Can I make graphite show the sum of 5m when retention is 1m? Want to see a graph with point every 5m with sum of that time period.
"@m1sp hey, do you have a good way to consume multiple json dumps into a single corpus? i've been just hacking it together."

"@jamuraa yupppp. jason doesn't have a lot of experience on twitter, it seems. or a very healthy world view."
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed &amp; threatened.
@GravityPike @tomdcc uhh. through what point of ingress?
i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
"@GemmaNoon it's what i'm *trying* to do, at least targeting specific groups/causes. it's tricky. have to look more at statistics than words."
@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?
@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have
@tomdcc you can only have one GV # per acct at any given time.
"I love amazon basics for misc accessories, but why does the power brick for this USB hub have to be so big? http://t.co/wZlHf99raY"

"@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal @davidsgallant he's OK. if we were stranded, both hungry, and i had a sandwich, i would probably give him half."
@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.
*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.
@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...
@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
Donating blood tomorrow. Pretty sure that I bleed twitter JSON metadata at this point.
"According to ralphreject, GDC is just a place for rich people to drink/do drugs. Jeez, guys. I guess I'll bring enough wine to share, then."
pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE

@Transition @GlennF @Spacekatgal that's the one.
"Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past."
"@GemmaNoon ie: things not as open for interpretation, such as numeric or boolean data (is following/is not following, etc)."
@RachelLite why would it?
"@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment."
"@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category."
"@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P"
"@Spacekatgal i'm FOSS at heart. i think the tools should be open for all to use. however, for monitoring services, things that require infra"

@BrentonPoke @Shjade totes SJW
"Just a reminder, this is the kind of logic &amp; reasoning that we've come to expect from GG: http://t.co/7RjxqC3ZsG"
@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
I just saw that 3 people requested that I update my Amazon Wish-List. Hm. I usually only use it to track things I plan on buying eventually.
Wow. I might be out of blue hair dye. But I have a tube of Pravana that is purple... // @TheQuinnspiracy
@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
@nimrod_KatDogg  i own too many apple products to say that.
"phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse."
@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
"@jackyalcine it's not a battery, it's a usb hub."
@Arlen weird. i have an address on my account. not sure if i need to add that to my wishlist or not.
"@EvvyKube no, I bathe in those."
@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
@limbclock i wouldn't do that.
@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
"I like how GG took TB's statement at http://t.co/6ADOWhlZfb to mean ""just hide the harassment in another subreddit"""
@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.
"Oh god. I am so stubborn.

"so, my yammering sleazeball cupcakes, you can go with http://t.co/TDToqiuQDc and i'll go my way.

I fight for the users."
"@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US, but we're also far removed from the class it would impact."
@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.
@limbclock if you only want 3 people to use it.
nichegamer got blacklisted by a gaming company. they responded by posting an article friday night about being blacklisted. oh boy.
@GlennF only if you want to laugh at how fucking privileged he is. what a tool.
Pretty sure that @ChrisWarcraft and I can take credit for Beck's comeback.
@sschinke @tomdcc that exists in web.
"@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad."
YES. I LOVE @lenadunham. http://t.co/ycgTBmmdxb
"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
"@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose."
@TheQuinnspiracy @ChrisWarcraft get crazy with the cheese whiz.
countdown to more companies following suit after seeing the way that was handled.
"@GlennF @Spacekatgal he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before. they were bad then, shockingly, still bad now."
@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?
"@sschinke @TsundereRager the latest version doesn't take this into account, iirc. i just added it to my custom bot blacklist."
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
"@GlennF @Spacekatgal it is rather funny how all of us are so completely different, yet complement each other's skill sets so well."
"@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests, GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers"
"add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
"@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean, unless you are becoming verified."
@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
"@sschinke @TsundereRager automated programs, whatever. it's not clearly written."
"I think we really need to talk about these, too: http://t.co/T1ZmOfLf9A"
"don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3"
"@sschinke @TsundereRager Unclear. ToS prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first, iirc."
@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.
@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
"@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded."
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
"@dylanw last i checked, baldwin was verified."
*gag* https://t.co/R4seYFa5s8 #stopwadhwa2015
"in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect."
@tomdcc accepting pull requests for better ideas that don't violate pseudonymity/privacy. &lt;3
@spacequeentbh so faded. :P need a hair cut + dye desperately.
"@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals."
does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.
fellow sockphiles: http://t.co/gVSIbpITFL
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.

@eevee @Manami_Fox @femfreq that has got to be one of the weirdest insults i've ever seen slung by an MRA/gater/whatever.
Here's a thought that would be fairly easy to implement: webapp that lets you get stats/links to mentions you received from blocked users.

That was fun. Now it's over. This is why I can't even consider sites like TechRaptr as anything more than hit piece blogs.

"@argonblue my perl is pretty readable. not as efficient, necessarily, but definitely possible for anyone to read &amp; understand."
@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.

".@georgieonthego Go ahead. I'd be interested in seeing what you fabricate. Hopefully they will be more creative than your ""articles""."

@xRainbowCutiex not sure. i didn't see it.
@youfoundthecard ?
Out of Pravana blue. Guess I'm stuck with mixing some clear with Special FX Turquoise to layer over existing hair. hmm. This might be good.
@Jules_Clarke @jmcefalas has more emotional impact when it's the face of a person reading it out loud.
@kencf0618 Being blocked isn't harassment.
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana?

"15 minutes. Nervous. Not because of speaking, but because of the content. Tech stuff is easier. So many feels. #GirlDevWeek"

@tarkasteve sorry about that. &gt;.&gt;
@SamanthaZeitlin I'm about to wander outside and enjoy the sun for a few minutes.
I'm not surprised. I wish I was. GamerGate turned a talk about anti-harassment into a live demonstration. #girldevweek

Then q&amp;a for both of us keynote speakers got hijacked to show harassment happening live. Both of us talked about diff aspects of harassment.
@coopatropp randi@randi.io
@coopatropp in a meeting...

@alexlifschitz YUP.
"Dude just yelled at me loud enough to hear over my music + noise canceling headphones. ""HEY GIRL. YOU WALK LIKE SWAAAGGER."" Fuck yeah, I do."
Let me make this perfectly fucking clear. Every female major target of GamerGate is seeing a fuckton more mentions tonight. #LawAndOrderSVU
@warrenleightTV @CizzymacHD pretty entertaining that they think NYS isn't a hashtag used to justify harassment. ^.^ Good job.

Thank you to everyone at #GirlDevWeek for the kind words. Thank you for letting me speak. Thank you for listening.
"Talked about the need for support, mentors. People that understand because they've been through it all, too."
Feeling kind of fantastic after standing on a stage to tell (&amp; show) people my experiences being harassed as a vocal woman in tech.
"@a_man_in_black you are helpful, valuable, and appreciated. your voice helps. we all appreciate you. you should know this."
"@jasonbentley sure, I think I can stop by for a bit. Giving a talk, but should be out of here by 1:15."
@coopatropp np. Will be home soon.

@LucifersLawyer @DeadpoolPewPew @TechyFolks @Spacekatgal I have no idea what just happened.
@RadiantImagesLC yup
"Literally Who?

Literally #LawAndOrderSVU."
"While some of those tweets are positive, the ratio of mentions with GG/NYS in them is MUCH higher than usual."
@BenKuchera only if I can get a pass somehow :/
Shit is about to get real.
It was difficult. I questioned if it was a good idea until someone in the crowd came forward for a hug &amp; started crying. Then I was crying.
@MaslabDroid yes
@a_man_in_black nothing ever happens overnight. it's subtle stages unnoticed by many. i know things are changing. i am watching it happen.
@peat i've got reason to believe that i'm not anywhere near hitting that cap. my numbers can be verified from other sources.
@desertfox899 original content. vs retweet.
"Here's another woman thanking you. I haven't seen the ep yet, but I've heard good things. Thank you. @warrenleightTV"
Gamergate started harassing #GirlDevWeek's organizer. So we spent the Q&amp;A livestreaming the tweets and discussing harassment.

@LiamPomfret I refuse to provide proof to any of those nutters. It won't make any difference. They just claim it's faked or defend it.
@M_Wein congrats ^.^
@DennisCEarl it was a podcast given by a woman in tech about how she doesn't want him to speak for her.
@cxarli glad it helped :)
@ilovegarick probably not. i can't really afford to go to conferences that i'm not speaking at. :(
On that Supernova facebook thread. Hoooooooly shit.
"Lots of love for @femfreq, @spacekatgal, @TheQuinnspiracy. I can't imagine how hard that was for them to watch. How violated they feel."

"Looking at GG hashtag, they were averaging abt 517 tweets/30m before #LawAndOrderSVU. Now, 1032.48/30m."
@MadcapOcelot I think @ameliagreenhall did that in her first blog post about him. Doing it programmatically is *really* hard.

@Spacekatgal I am so sorry that you're in this situation.

@MyersNFL that bacon is pretty cheap.
"She also claimed that women being angry with Wadhwa was worse than the death threats we were getting because we're ""used to it""."
"OK. Who wants to go see 50 shades of grey up in Emeryville? (braces self for the onslaught of ""NOT A HEALTHY PORTRAYAL OF BDSM"")"

I reached out to @ninaburleigh with concerns the day the article was published. No response. Nina cares more about page views than problems.
"@KaitlynBurnell given the *massive* glee i'm seeing from GG irt that tweet, it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'"
He's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed.
"According to @ninaburleigh, we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism. Even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong."
@functionalform you should see his guilty look.
@PeerWorker and i couldn't give less fucks about alienating followers by giving them an opinion they don't like.

There is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. He has defended GamerGate in the past.

I... I either just got really lucky or somehow found a way around the ashran queue timer. uh.
I'm not even going to lie. This makes me giggle a little bit on the inside.
"This is the best point I've seen made about #thedress, ever. @lead_miniature"
"No one said threats weren't serious. However, there's a difference between ISIS and GamerGate. @PeerWorker"
".@PeerWorker online harassment is a serious problem, and it needs to be addressed. but making false equivalencies won't get you anywhere."
"@PeerWorker you made a false equivalency, I called it on you, and you threatened financial consequences."
@PeerWorker @EvvyKube uh. You came to me with financial threats.
@voiceofrae @TheQuinnspiracy @Spacekatgal BUT HERE'S MY NUMBER
@JordanL @TheQuinnspiracy @voiceofrae @Spacekatgal i don't know. but i feel like @haley would.
@KirinDave uh. hi. i'm going to call you on that line right there. what rating do you play at in WoW?
@RealDackFayden @tauriqmoosa yeah. i tried to talk to him. he won't even tell me why he thinks this is a thing.
"@KirinDave I love it. I'm invested in it. My friends play it. I've played GW. It's ok, but the PvP just isn't as good."
WIRED IS WRONG.
@PeerWorker @DerAmazingLarry @Quinnae_Moon @feministing stop trying to cause shit. it's not going to work.
"Let me make this super fucking clear. I will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations. That isn't happening, ever."
"Sorry, I'm not going to say GamerGate is the same as ISIS, and you can shove your donation up your ass. @PeerWorker"
"@PeerWorker @EvvyKube when you're an asshole in someone's mentions and they react, it's not bullying."
"@KirinDave &amp; if you want to sulk about being called on it, i guess that's your prerogative."
@hideous_pizza i am grandma. :P

"To be clear, I'm not in trouble. And the call with PD has nothing to do w/call with lawyer, both related to work :P @MrTheGeoff"
@voiceofrae @TheQuinnspiracy @Spacekatgal SO CALL ME MAYBE
"Look, I don't care about your photoshops, or your computers, or your wizardry. The earth isn't flat and #TheDress is white and gold."
@PeerWorker @EvvyKube show me where I called you stupid.
@PeerWorker I'm from the south. Sweetie is another way to talk down and tell someone to go fuck themselves.
"@PeerWorker @DerAmazingLarry @Quinnae_Moon @feministing however, I'm going to block you now. Because what you're doing is abusive and not OK"
@KirinDave i will punch you.
@StephenAtWar @PeerWorker @krisaubuchon yup. something is happening. not sure what.
"@KirinDave GW2 players love to make digs at WoW being old. WoW is old, but it's also pretty well balanced. I PvP competitively."

@PeerWorker @EvvyKube it's about ethics in journalism.
@JoeMOwens newp.
"@PeerWorker @EvvyKube you've now repeatedly told people that I called you stupid, though."
@PeerWorker I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Go fuck yourself.
You're not going to get the response you're looking for. Give up. @PeerWorker
@jlorry96 he also makes claims of racism if someone calls him on repeatedly using feminist terms incorrectly. i. don't. care.

I'm optimistic. This isn't the end game. Twitter's announcement was a single step in a long path in mitigating abuse problems.

FYGM is keeping the status quo so you can feel some kind of superiority over the women that opted not to put up with the abuse.
Star Trek was one of the only TV shows I  could watch when I was a kid.
@Animecommentary no worries.

It's easy to think that our experiences are indicative of everyone's experiences. I've fallen victim to that thinking before.
Let's not forget that the person that started these rumblings about my code got fired from Zynga for being impossible to work with.
"Unfortunately, a positive experience doesn't cancel out a negative. And playing the ""cool girl"" game isn't a good look for anyone."
More shit that dudes don't have to put up with. http://t.co/VW943zqxcT
this isn't just gamergate this isn't just gamergate this isn't just gamergate this is a more obvious version of what already happens
Watching people like @GMShivers further FYGM culture. That's... unfortunate.
"http://t.co/9yNL4eQcMP is a good option, but it's a partial solution. We need the ability to filter accts w/o phone number attached."

"If us women in tech are strong enough to get this far, why aren't we strong enough to mentor, to push for change? No more FYGM."
The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists
Things are happening. Big things. I could not be more excited.1

Couldn't find another job in the gaming industry after that because insulting your coworkers/former employers is just something you don't do
"@jeremiahfelt Twitter, email, Evernote, web. Hearthstone."

"I didn't have an outward emotional reaction when my own grandmother died, but I am crying for Nimoy."
"Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry, these are just words that mean little."
Vibrating with excitement. Every day brings us closer to being able to make the announcement.
@gamerfortruth @athenahollow rogue literally got fired from the company that made farmville. no one wanted to work w/him there.
"FYGM culture is a complete lack of empathy. I fought my way here, sure. Do I think anyone else should have to do that? Hell, no."
@arhourigan @Spacekatgal it's been my name for many years :) since before Twitter existed.
iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3?
@TheDaveCA oh yeah? i didn't hear about that.
@InfiniteClock most abuse comes from gamergate accounts that are 30-90 days old.
"FYGM culture is a real issue. Like, ""I fought my way here, and it sucked, but I'm strong. If you can't do this, it's your problem."""
Not so subtle hint: just spent a while with apple opening up a very specific kind of account.
My take on twitter's safety update: propaganda. Doesn't give clear info on what these new actions are.
I'm going to drink and Star Trek marathon tonight.
"@tmclaughbos yo, are you going to #bsdcan? @bsdtrhodes is going to be there. we could cause trouble. ;P"

"@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r to be fair, most of my activity happened under my own commit bit."
More than a little entertained at all of the gaters that are upset that I fight back instead of just shutting up. Fighting back is bullying.
"@MacLemon @dtm609 @Osw94k you're thinking kernel, not userland. quite a bit of recent(ish) freebsd userland exists in osx."
"So she can try &amp; claim innocence, but statistics paint her as being someone to avoid. And I've been in her sights for a while. Oh well."
How should I even classify this? Wielding a mob? Indirect bullying? I'm not sure.
"@PhoenixDK i'm thinking about it. ideas aren't really fully formed, though."
@leel8on indeed. although the police were fairly nice. :)
Like when @GMShivers said that only industry newbies believed sexism existed. Or when @JennofHardwire sends her harassment squad after ppl.

"@MacLemon @dtm609 @Osw94k not entirely accurate. if you run strings through /bin, you'll find freebsd committer names of recent years."
They also love to add 10 years to my age. Which doesn't bother me. I grew up envious of UNIX beards.
"@Makofury glad I could help, and I'm so sorry that you're going through that. :("
@Nayadrikj STOP TAKING BATHROOM SELFIES YOU FUCKING PEASANT
@iglvzx he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will.
"UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters, darling. FreeBSD uses SVN, not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github."
"btw, guys. I'm an admin of the OpenBSD facebook group. So, you know. COLLUSION."
It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.
@Osw94k I would put cash money on them not understanding your profile pic.
Posing for extra style points before wrecking *everyone*. #selfie #warlords http://t.co/Jr11tzm49x
All that collusion in the BSD community sure is hard to keep track of.
"@SlaunchaMan interesting, tho, that it still found most of them."
"INTEL, YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US"

@scaryjen @Alfuriuskj @Nayadrikj undead 4ever.
@tpw_rules I can prove that my code is in FreeBSD. And there are articles that state that FreeBSD is running on the PS3 and PS4.
"OK, that's enough poking the bear. Have a lot to do today. My most difficult decision is going to be what to wear. &gt;.&gt;"
"In short, this is the most hilarious GamerGate BSD fail I have ever seen. #FreeBSD #OpenBSD #PCBSD http://t.co/poaOZ93QEf"
@basvandewiel there should be a link to this in the patreon. :)
"PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems, the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD."
"@jessimckenzi @zeynep @twitter @delbius @TweetDeck confirmed, seeing the same thing in *web*."
BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking.

That moment when I think that I'm out of coffee... then pull 12 oz of ground arabica out of my backpack. Yes! More glory to the coffee gods.
And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.
The amount of Mean Girls mentality coming from GG supporters is hilarious. ON WEDNESDAYS WE EMAIL KOTAKU.
@JordanL yup!
@PhoenixDK i think there's a really fine line beyond being vocal about your experiences and indirect bullying.
"""I don't retreat.

"This might be my favorite tweet by rogue, ever. https://t.co/HhSQGdlHgN  Because he assumes my twitter handle is my UNIX login."
ie: they will still feel this way in 5 years. lollll.
@SilverMillsy nope! 34 in september. :)
@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r but rogue isn't really... dev competent. he thinks all dev happens under github.
"But all of these attacks of ""not enough commits"" or ""had a dude do it for you"" or ""slept with people"" proves my point. Thanks for that."
@SlaunchaMan that's still not my login for freebsd. :P
"@stubbornella people will find a way to interpret anything to match their message, unfortunately."
"I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them."
Presented without comment. http://t.co/9MWQFS8Css
My fav part of skimming GG tweets is seeing so many people insist that they are unable to develop their views with experience.
"I've been watching Jenn for a while, deciding if it was worth saying anything. Her tweets are benign, but the *response* is not."
"So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is ""how can we help?"""
There's a reason we started tracking all of her followers. An immense amount of racism/sexism/abuse was coming from her corner.
Pointed freebsd devs at this thread. Their response: now discussing if they have hipster beards. http://t.co/Bizo592TMj used as an example.
Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious.
it's like christmas.
"@zeynep @twitter @delbius omg, is that what happened? i keep hitting the wrong button."
"""If you have ever felt personally victimized by ethics in games journalism, raise your hand"""
"@mdesjardins for some parts of the company, yes. a lot of freebsd devs work there."

"Hey guys. Look at this little cutie, trying to bully me. :P https://t.co/IMyjQjVyRz"
@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r I think I got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code I was working with. :)
"The thing is, you don't actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from. It's easy to track social groups."

"@ArtifexH I thought about putting one of the monitors on top, but then it's too high for me to easily see."
I only really have the time to respond to mainstream media. Reviewing everything that GG writes about me would be too time consuming.

Perpetuating a culture where abuse is tolerated and targets of abuse are mocked for speaking out against their abusers.
GamerGate is an intimidation mob. Speak up? Get threats &amp; dog-piled. Speak about the threats? Get mocked &amp; dog-piled.

@PaladinGunn thanks. :)
"We have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy. First, we have @femfreq. Amazing advocacy. A voice that is far reaching."
I cannot get this goofy grin off my face.
"@ncoghlan_dev i'm a jerk with an ego the size of texas, and i'm still having probs wrapping my head around it."
"It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms."
@harper @korvys it's also a license I know well. I agree with the philosophy behind it.
"You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion."
@harper @korvys I don't like the GPL.
We will be releasing as many tools as possible under the BSD license. @korvys
"The scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it. Often this leads to thinking, ""what can I do? I'm just one person."""

@SantaCruzTax soon. We've been working on it. Gotta move fast.
Soon soon soon
The amount of kind words and support we've received from all of you has been immense. Thank you all so very much.
It is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle.

@ashleylynch @join_oapi there's very little in specifics that I am free to discuss at this point. But I can give some overview.
"We know what online abuse looks like. We've been studying it, and we will create reports and publish our findings."
@arrivalgame you too!
"Online harassment is something most people have faced at some point, regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism."
You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this.

@StephenAtWar me too. I can't wait until I'm free to talk about more :)
"For more egregious cases for harassment, we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately. But most toxicity isn't this."

"@ludist absolutely. :)  i'm still cracking up that the ONE TIME i wear a superhero cape on BART, I run into someone that I (sorta) know."
"@Cactus_Soup90 you can't filter, with the exception of blocks."
"People are making an interesting case irt libel and some things GG is saying about OAPI, but honestly, my dance card is already full."
We knew when we started this that a movement based on harassment would do anything in their power to stop it.
@charlesrandall definitely in progress. I really want to give a TED talk at some point on engineering tech to solve social problems.

"I try to make a habit out of not responding to their conspiracy theories, but that one was too funny not to share. :)"

Stop calling for the head of whoever made that @googlecloud tweet earlier. It was retracted. That is not a reasonable response.
I need to stop frantically typing up responses to emails (to be sent after being reviewed by the rest of my board) and get my butt to GDC.
One of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human. We can do better.

"@cwalker iirc, tweetbot is a paid app. :)  i'm not necessarily thinking full-fledged client."

That was a comment taken from Polygon's article on the #1RTB panel. http://t.co/v5yK2J14ko
"So it would auto-unmute after N hours, or whatever."
"Seeing a lot of talk about GDC vs PAX. I felt safer at GDC post-GamerGate than I did at PAX pre-GamerGate. So, there's that."

"@athenahollow i've been mostly ignoring it, but she's clearly fixated and making weird accusations. has never once directly talked to me."
@athenahollow i'm a monogamous girl in a polygamous world.
@Robobengt also a few famous people followed me and now i'm freaking out that i tweet too much &amp; don't want to scare them off. :P

@SirGoldenrod @sloshedtrain2 @theMirai @srhbutts @Moldybars because they have no legitimate complaints. even hackernews says it works fine.
People keep asking me about the stuff I posted about that site &amp; ties to rooshv. http://t.co/eEDxrUjDxE dun dun DUNNNNNN
"@SatoshiKsutra @Popehat @DarkTechMonitor @freebsdgirl yes there is, you illegitimate cockwaffle. stay in school."
.@moldybars congrats on finding that bug. I'm sure gamergate is totes going to care.
@ELLIOTTCABLE dogs are good for that. :P
@Patashu0 the dog manages to fit himself into tiny crates.
"er, THOSE."
About to meet this puppy. Shepherd mix. A bit bigger than I wanted. We'll see.
@petecheslock a *really bad* data scientist that is yelling about harassment because i pointed out flaws in his work lololol
"If anyone blocked disbelieves this claim, they are welcome to follow @Moldybar's instructions and see if they can follow/RT/fav my tweets."
A little concerned at what is happening here. Uh. This story may not be over.
"@ChrisWarcraft as someone that is continuing to be harassed by ED since it was formed over a decade ago, can confirm."
@banhammor it's not true. see last 2 tweets.
@Popehat the text shown in the image was not satricial. that dude is dead serious (and not a scientist)

@Popehat @SatoshiKsutra @DarkTechMonitor you have to follow some pretty heinous people to get on ggautoblocker. :(  that list isn't public.
@Megalonyx_ THIS IS MINE
@LynnMagic people think that implying association via follow is a bad thing. but it's shockingly accurate.
"@petecheslock after he tried pulling the ""you don't need to be here, woman, because i'm so senior and i've already done this"""
@MoerasGrizzly ggautoblocker has been absorbed by OAPI. it's been rewritten in ruby. will have a new project out soon. ;)
"the puppy is trying to hump leo and leo is just like ""EXCUSE ME"" and now i have a 60 lb lapdog."
"Bummed that I lost out on this adorable puppy, but glad the original owners were able to reclaim her."
"No puppy today. This puppy had some pretty severe anxiety issues. I can work with that, but leo would not be happy."
@tehrebound ME TOO
"Oh god. I was first. I have dibs. If I take this puppy, I'm going to feel like such an asshole."
"@Popehat @SatoshiKsutra @DarkTechMonitor frankly, i'm quite amazed that i'm not on theblockbot yet."
This is the most drama I have ever seen about a dog.

@theMirai @SirGoldenrod @sloshedtrain2 @srhbutts it's incorrect. it's in no way related to email addresses (are these people technical?)
@MoerasGrizzly it has ties to other unpublished projects. need to publish them all at once.
"@petecheslock dude is kind of a joke in the industry, so it's no wonder he's having to flail into GG's good graces."
@DarkTechMonitor @Popehat @SatoshiKsutra @freebsdgirl cowardice. avoiding harassment is cowardice. go shit on a poptart. &lt;3
Aaand the owners just walked in to claim the puppy. The police are not happy.

@cperciva i know. my heart is breaking. (not really. i do tweet a *LOT*)

@dreamachineries yup. my other dog's name is leo. :)

@BrownBagPantry @LaurieJWillberg Hi. This isn't targeted harassment. It is not direct nor specific. You're encouraging mass reporting.
@the_moth_reborn :P hopefully you didn't get spammed with notifications.
"@BrownBagPantry or perhaps twitter's userbase, and humanity at large. Everyone's a jerk sometimes."
"@jaredchase runes on the ground, you have to step in them, thing surrounds you to absorb dmg, but it does dmg. gotta dps it slowly.."
"Yeah, I get threats. And it means I have to be cautious. But really, I'm crazy enough to think I'm unbreakable, which is why this works."
"@BrownBagPantry to be fair, none of those things have anything to do with twitter's ToS or even free speech, for that matter. :P"
"Things I am not scared of:

Whiny manbabies.
A lot of twitter mentions.
Public speaking.

"@mcmahoniel there's a lot of sarcasm and doublespeak in this group, especially. appropriation of terms. text filters just don't work."
@filmpunk86 i'm aware. i've read that story arc.
@jaredchase killing you how?
@beardyblue never feel bad about that. it's pretty intense if you're not prepared for it.
@BrownBagPantry mean words aren't harassment. They aren't direct and specific threats.
Watch http://t.co/8YC7xTDA2U to see @TheQuinnspiracy! Just a few more minutes. :)
@SFtheWolf many people would be scared &amp; triggered by that cover. :P
"@BrownBagPantry Fortunately, we've got controls on Twitter like block and mute, which keep us from seeing *most* things we don't like."
"@SFtheWolf but the cover itself - well, the tweets capped in that article do a better job explaining than i could."
@SFtheWolf did you read the text of the article? that picture is really creepy/triggering as fuck.
@Chickowits I call out people like Jenn because she is causing problems by flooding join_oapi. It's moronic.
It's blurry because they were spinning in circles.
"@WBrokenbourgh I use it on AWS constantly, but that's probably not helpful. ;)  Anything Dell tends to work fairly well, though."
That's why we have @join_oapi. Because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right.

@beardyblue it takes a pretty specific personality type to be able to take this shit on voluntarily.
@jaredchase but LFR is derp.

"@SFtheWolf @max2000warlord no worries. the whole ""you scare easily"" is seriously the most hilarious thing I've seen all day."
